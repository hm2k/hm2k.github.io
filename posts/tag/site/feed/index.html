<p><a href="http://www.geekinthepark.co.uk/">Geek in the Park</a> is a day-long event for geeks (mainly web developers) to have a get together.</p>
<p>The event is going to be held in <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Jephson+Pl,+Willes+Rd,+Leamington+Spa+CV31,+United+Kingdom&amp;sll=52.793338,-2.147051&amp;sspn=0.008758,0.020084&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=3&amp;geocode=0,52.286316,-1.523581&amp;ll=52.288316,-1.527379&amp;spn=0.002215,0.005021&amp;t=h&amp;z=18">Jephson Gardens, </a><a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Jephson+Pl,+Willes+Rd,+Leamington+Spa+CV31,+United+Kingdom&amp;sll=52.793338,-2.147051&amp;sspn=0.008758,0.020084&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=3&amp;geocode=0,52.286316,-1.523581&amp;ll=52.288316,-1.527379&amp;spn=0.002215,0.005021&amp;t=h&amp;z=18">Leamington Spa, Warwickshire</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Picnic during the day, followed by The Discussion in the evening. The event starts on Saturday at noon and everything should wrap up by around 11pm.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;and yes, I will be attending.</p>
<p>So, come see me at Geek in the Park on Saturday 9th August 2008. Put it in your diary!</p>
<p>I aim to get there around mid-day, but have been known to be fashionably late.</p>
<p><span class="url">You&#8217;ll find me listed on both the </span><a class="url" rel="external" href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/665107/">Upcoming</a> and <a class="url" rel="external" href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=18849565907">Facebook</a><span class="url"> event pages.</span></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to visit the <a href="http://2008.geekinthepark.co.uk/">Geek in the Park</a> website and add your email address to the announcements.</p>
<p>For those of you on IRC, you can visit #webdev @ EFnet to discuss it further.</p>
<p><em>See you there!</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure some of you are wondering what twitter actually is. The best way to describe it is a way to tell people you know what you&#8217;re up to. It fills the gap between emails and blogs.</p>
<p>This way, your friends can find out what you&#8217;re up to without having to actually ask you, and only if they&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>Quite a novel idea.<span id="more-186"></span></p>
<p>However, I found myself NOT using it. My reasoning behind this was mainly because loading the site in a browser, logging in, and submitting a message was a rather long winded process.</p>
<p>However, thankfully, as it turns out, they have an API which I can send my message to along with my login details to update my status.</p>
<p>And so it was born! <a href="http://hm2k.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/code/mirc/twitter.mrc">Twitter for mIRC</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment the script is just an updater, maybe in the future I will write some RSS feed reader for mIRC so you can see what your friends are doing on twitter via mIRC, but only if the demand is there&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all I&#8217;d like to say thanks to everyone who has visited my website since I began at the start of last month.</p>
<p>So far I have been going pretty much full steam ahead with this, releasing all my articles and posts I could think of, at a rate of 1 per day.</p>
<p>Over the next few months my other projects are pretty much going to take a front seat, which will mean I will have less time for this website.</p>
<p>I am going to attempt to make a post every few days or so. You can keep track of my posts by adding the RSS feed to Firefox or your RSS reader.</p>
<p>If you use any of my projects, scripts, or found any of my information useful, please provide me with feedback by leaving a comment in the relevant place or contacting me via IRC or by email.</p>
<p>Thanks and Enjoy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some time I have been meaning to update my website, I had decided long ago that if I did create a new site it would use the wordpress engine, as I didn&#8217;t like the updates of the engine I used previously, which was cutenews.</p>
<p>On the 12th of August 2006 I purchased back HM2K.com after not having it since 2002, I decided to use this for my new site.</p>
<p>Before I created a new site I wanted to decide on a purpose, giving the site more focus resulting in a more successful website. After some time I realised what it was that I wanted to do with my website.</p>
<p>I wanted to make it a central point where I could document my (almost daily) research. As part of my work I find myself doing a lot of research, gathering information on many issues, perhaps information that does exist, but with limited coverage or such. The purpose of the site would be to report my findings on my website, not only for my personal use but to assist others.</p>
<p>In addition to this I would place details of my projects and articles I have written in the past.<br />
And so the new site was born.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
