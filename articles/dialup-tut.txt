Dial-Up Networking Tutorial
---------------------------

I made this tutorial because people kept asking me how to do it,
so here it is:

This tutorial is designed to help you use Internet Connections that

are grabbed from SubSeven ie:

[Connection: HM2K FREE ONLINE]
login: HM2K
password: HM2K
phone number: 0845 1400105

Go to the folder in 'My Computer' Called 'Dial-Up Networking' (DUN)
Double click 'Make New Connection'
Replace 'My Connection' with The Bit after 'Connection: '
And click 'Next'
As the Area code put the first 4 numbers
As the Telephone number put the last digits
then click 'Next'
then click 'Finish'
then go back to the Dial-Up Networking folder
Double click The New Connection that you made

Change the User name using the 'login'
and the Password
and click Save Password
then click 'Connect'
and now either click cancel or continuse to connect to the web
