					<description><![CDATA[I had this same issue with my Pavilion N5340. Since I am the original owner and only user of this notebook, I know it was never handled rough, etc.

About 2 years ago, I acquired an Pavilion XF235 from craigslist.org (Free) - with a bad power connector.

I recently acquired an Omnibook XE3-GC from E-bay for about $3. - with a bad power connector. 

This is such a common problem with HP notebooks, it is difficult to believe they were not aware of the issue. 

A couple of repair tips:

1) Be sure to remove the standoff screws from the external connectors for the printer, display, etc. (otherwise, the main board can not be removed)

2) After soldering the new connector in place. Apply a few drops of epoxy between the connector and the board. This relieves some of the stress from the solder joints and seems to make the repair last longer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the article. I think this is also the cause on my gf&#039;s laptop. It only charges when the adapter plug is pushed to the right. I reckon a broken joint somewhere from the DC to the motherboard. Now at least i know it can be done and parts are available.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just as annoying is a cable fracture, just at the Jack Plug (this occurs very frequently). I cant find anywhere to buy a new self fit plug, as all you need to do is cut the cable below the fracture and fit a replacement plug. Can you get a jack plug...... not on your nelly, you have to buy a new power adapter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi All

I must congratulate those brave enough to venture into their laptops in order to replace the DC jack, I must warn the rest of you that this is not a job to be taken lightly.

It is very easy to damage many components of the laptop if you are not careful, or are inexperienced with taking it apart.

We see many laptops in which have been damaged through DIY repairs. Most (if not all) would have been cheaper to fix if sent into to an experienced technician in the first place.

There are many companies throughout the UK who will offer this level of repair - however, not all are equal. If you are looking around, check their small print and any warranty that comes with the repair. Most only offer a 30-90 day warranty with this type of repair. There are a few, including us, which offer a 12 month warranty which shows how confident we are with the quality of our repairs.

Good luck!

					<description><![CDATA[Just get a DC jack from Maplins (or Radio Shack if you&#039;re USA) and mount it to the laptop case, then solder this to the + and - on the motherboard. Cost me £3.50 inc delivery!

Eventually looks like this:

This is what i&#039;m going to do when i find out how to remove the motherboard from my girlfriend&#039;s ifriend/novatech laptop!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Update: I had to do this again recently. I realised how much I hate doing it. There&#039;s so many screws and so many things to do. In the end it probably isn&#039;t worth doing. I would recommend getting a reliable laptop repair centre to do it, ensure they offer a fixed fee, and will only charge if they fix the issue.

Hope this helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there
Nice guide, it saved me tons to time :D.
Just fixed a ze4111s... turned out that the powerplug was loose. I sanded the motherbord (and the pcb-lanes) a bit to get the protective coating off, so that the solder would last a bit better.]]></description>
