					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been attempting to get this working for a week, except on an Ubuntu host (dom0). From what I can tell, recompiling the Ubuntu host to run a non-PAE hypervisor and kernel crashes the system (I.E. it complains something about running a non-PAE kernel on a PAE hypervisor, even though I made sure that both are non-PAE, etc.) I&#039;ve also tried to recompile the 7.0-BETA2 FreeBSD kernel to have all the XEN and PAE options enabled, but the stock GENERIC kernel doesn&#039;t have the XEN extensions and the Kip kernel source that I&#039;ve downloaded throws hundreds of compiler errors. So, from what I can tell, there is no way to get a PAE XEN kernel under FreeBSD 7.0 (at least BETA2). Also, when I&#039;ve gotten around the actual compiler errors, I ran across a line that said &quot;PAE under XEN not supported.&quot;, and actually stopped the compilation. So, I would think that using VMware server (which is where I went as well, after attempting Qemu, which I thought would be less CPU intensive, would be a better choice... it crashed too often and doesn&#039;t have very good networking support) is the only viable alternative. I really like the Xen methodology, but its pretty useless if its not supported ubiquitously.

					<description><![CDATA[Good writeup, and nice to know CentOS-5 can do xen-dom0 out of the box.
Too bad PAE gets in the way like that. They should make PAE-enabled domU kernel available or the default. VMware server does a pretty good job of running FreeBSD, another option is jail or qemu.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ultimately, I gave up on Xen, and used vmware server.

I&#039;ve yet to contact the developers, the general consensus I got from their sites, etc, is that development on this has stopped.

I feel the Xen open source community is very disconnected.]]></description>
