										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you use Photoshop for any kind of graphic or web design, you&#8217;ll understand the importance of having an array of fonts to choose from.</p>
<p>However, you may soon find yourself with a font overload. The problem is that once you get over about 1000 fonts in your Windows directory (usually &#8220;C:\Windows\Fonts\&#8221;) you&#8217;ll find that windows becomes very slow, particularly at startup.</p>
<p>To get around this, you don&#8217;t add the fonts to Windows, instead you add them into Photoshop, which is able to handle many more fonts than simply loading them into Windows.</p>
<p><span id="more-470"></span></p>
<p>The trick is to put them into the Adobe common fonts folder under program files (usually &#8220;C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Fonts\&#8221;).</p>
<p>You can get to this directory by going to Start &gt; Run and issuing the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Adobe\Fonts</p></blockquote>
<p>This should bring you to a directory called &#8220;fonts&#8221;, place your fonts in here and they will be loaded when Photoshop loads.</p>
<p>The more fonts you put in here, the longer Adobe Photoshop will take to load, however, Windows will perform a lot better overall this way.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re downloading fonts from <a href="http://www.dafont.com/">dafont.com</a> like me, you&#8217;ll find that you&#8217;ll need to extract them from the zip file before you place them into this directory, although to most people that should be obvious.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to reload Photoshop for the new font to start working, it should appear in the drop down menu straight away.</p>
<p>I had to do this the other day for the first time in ages on a new machine I had setup Adobe Photoshop CS3 on. I realised that I had forgotten the details! Once I had reminded myself I figured I would write it up here for future reference.</p>
<p>This should work on any version of Photoshop above 5.5, including Photoshop 6, 7, CS, CS2, CS3 and CS4.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
