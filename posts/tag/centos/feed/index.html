										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A customer got in touch with us and explained their situation.<a href="http://labs.phurix.net/upload/Envelope.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3328" title="Envelope" src="http://labs.phurix.net/upload/Envelope.png" alt="" width="256" height="256" srcset="https://hm2k.org/upload/Envelope.png 256w, https://hm2k.org/upload/Envelope-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></a></p>
<p>They need to setup their email on the go and configure some forwarders. Their issue was that they were never given access to the control panel by the account holder and have since lost touch.</p>
<p>This unfortunately left them in a situation where they had no control over their hosting, they asked me to help them out.</p>
<p>My task was to migrate their existing IMAP mailboxes to their hosting account on one of our cPanel servers&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-3322"></span></p>
<p>The first thing I did was get their UK domain onto our TAG giving us control over that for a small cost of £10+VAT, which the customer was only happy to pay.</p>
<p>There are other ways to get control of the domain without the cost, such as dealing with the host directly but in this case, fasthosts refuses to communicate with you unless you&#8217;re a customer. Ridiculous.</p>
<p>From here on inward, you&#8217;ll need root access to cPanel WHM on your server, or know someone who has.</p>
<p>At this point you need to start to create your mailboxes on the new server that match up to the existing ones.</p>
<p>The only issue with this is that you may find you can&#8217;t add &#8220;Remote Domains&#8221; (domains hosted elsewhere).</p>
<blockquote><p>This item lets you allow cPanel users to create parked and addon domains that resolve to other servers. To make your selection, click the button corresponding to the option you wish to use. This value defaults to Off.</p>
<p>Warning: Enabling this option can cause major security issues. We strongly recommend that you do not enable this option.</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to &#8220;<a href="http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/WHMDocs/TweakSettings#Domains">Allow Remote Domains</a>&#8221; (Under &#8220;Tweak Settings&#8221; in WHM) so you&#8217;re able to add the domain. Once added, you can turn it off again.</p>
<p>As I said, once the domain is added you can <a href="http://www.cpanel.net/media/tutorials/emailaccounts.htm">create your mailboxes</a> in cPanel to match what you already have.</p>
<p>I then went ahead and added them to the customer&#8217;s email client (Outlook 2007) to make sure everything was working as expected (it was).</p>
<p>They should have two sets of accounts added for each email address, the only difference between them should be the servers they use.</p>
<h3>Migrating</h3>
<p>This is where the fun starts.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve tried moving messages before in Outlook you&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s pretty slow. The issue is that, you&#8217;re downloading the message from the existing server, copying it to your computer, then uploading it to the other server.</p>
<p>This is a slow process, especially if you&#8217;re on regular UK broadband. In addition to that, you&#8217;ll find that Outlook will lock up while it waits for the server to respond.</p>
<p>I tested moving a few thousand messages: it took 8 hours. At this rate it would take around a week to do all of the accounts which isn&#8217;t feasible in a live environment.</p>
<p>Thunderbird isn&#8217;t much better. There had to be a better solution&#8230;</p>
<p>I got in touch with cPanel, as they have a dedicated &#8220;migration&#8221; team, however they were asking for shell, ftp or control panel access, none of which the customer had.</p>
<p>At first I had considered a server side, IMAP compatible email client such as Mutt or PINE, but I felt this may be a bit cumbersome.</p>
<p>Enter imapsync&#8230;</p>
<h3>imapsync</h3>
<p>After a quick search I came across imapsync which appears to be the solution I was looking for.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s written in Perl and is open source so there&#8217;s no reason it shouldn&#8217;t run on a CentOS server.</p>
<p>To install imapsync on CentOS (with cPanel) you&#8217;ll need to do the following:</p>
<p>First of all, imapsync isn&#8217;t in any of the official CentOS repositories so you need to install the <a href="http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/RPMForge">RPMForge repository</a>.</p>
<p>So, for example, on a CentOS 4 i386 install I would do:</p>
<blockquote><p>wget http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el4.rf.i386.rpm</p>
<p>rpm -i rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el4.rf.i386.rpm</p></blockquote>
<p>Now it&#8217;s installed, you can utilise it by using yum combined with &#8220;&#8211;enablerepo=rpmforge&#8221; to install imapsync.</p>
<p>However, before you go ahead and do that, you need to realise that because cPanel has it&#8217;s own set of perl modules and blocks the OS ones, you need to disable the &#8220;exclude&#8221; line in the yum configuration file.</p>
<blockquote><p>nano -w /etc/yum.conf</p>
<p>Note: Use whatever editor you prefer, I&#8217;m using nano. The -w is for no word wrap as this file contains long lines.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this file, you need to comment out the following like:</p>
<blockquote><p>#exclude=apache* bind-chroot courier* dovecot* exim* filesystem httpd* mod_ssl* mysql* nsd* perl* php* pr$</p></blockquote>
<p>The hash (#) at the beginning means it&#8217;ll no longer be parsed, so nothing is excluded.</p>
<p>Now you can go ahead and install imapsync trouble free:</p>
<blockquote><p>yum install imapsync &#8211;enablerepo=rpmforge</p></blockquote>
<p>This should install imapsync and any dependencies (such as the required perl modules).</p>
<p>The only advice that cPanel gave me when doing this is:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is possible this could break some components of cPanel, but it should be generally repairable as long as you run &#8220;/scripts/checkperlmodules &#8211;full &#8211;force&#8221; afterwards to rebuild/reinstall the cPanel versions of the various modules.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suggest you also do that once imapsync is installed to ensure you don&#8217;t break anything in cPanel.</p>
<h3>Migration</h3>
<p>Now we have imapsync installed we can actually use it&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>imapsync \
       --host1 mail.example.co.uk --authmech1 PLAIN --user1 joe.blogs@example.co.uk --password1 12345678 \
       --host2 lemon.phurix.com --authmech2 PLAIN --user2 joe.blogs@example.co.uk --password2 99999999</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This should be enough to get you going, but do be aware of the SECURITY issues outlined in the <a href="http://ks.lamiral.info/imapsync/README">imapsync README</a>.</p>
<p>Once this is done, all you need to do is get the name servers (or just the MX) changed on the domain to new hosting and after about 4 hours you should be good to go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It should be easy right? Just &#8220;yum install subversion&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nope. You get this error message:</p>
<blockquote><p>Error: Missing Dependency: perl(URI) &gt;= 1.17 is needed by package</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-684"></span>It&#8217;s not a problem in CentOS, no, it&#8217;s a restriction created by cPanel to control what is installed using yum.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit your &#8220;/etc/yum.conf&#8221; file.</li>
<li>Remove &#8220;perl*&#8221; from the &#8220;exclude&#8221; line.</li>
<li>Run your &#8220;yum install subversion&#8221;</li>
<li>Add the &#8220;perl*&#8221; back to the &#8220;exclude&#8221; line in the yum file.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s it! It will install as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using CentOS4 you may get the following error when exporting:</p>
<pre>[user@server ~]$ svn export http://server/svn/project/directory/filename
svn: REPORT request failed on '/svn/project/!svn/vcc/default'
svn:
Cannot replace a directory from within</pre>
<p>This is caused by <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1708" rel="nofollow">a bug</a> which was <a href="http://svn.collab.net/viewvc/svn?view=revision&amp;revision=12686" rel="nofollow">fixed</a> and released in subversion version 1.2.0, however, RHEL4 (Redhat Enterprise Linux 4) and CentOS 4 use Subversion 1.1.4 from 2005 which doesn&#8217;t have this fix.</p>
<p>The solution is to install the latest version of SVN from a third party repository such as <a href="http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/RPMForge">RPMForge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>wget http://pkgs.repoforge.org/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el4.rf.i386.rpm</p>
<p>rpm -Uhv rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el4.rf.i386.rpm</p></blockquote>
<p>Once RPMForge (and RPMForge extras) is setup, simply run:</p>
<blockquote><p>yum install &#8211;enablerepo=rpmforge-extras subversion</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I keep getting this error:</p>
<blockquote><p>Error Copying File or Folder</p>
<p>Cannot copy xxx: The specified network name is no longer available.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><span id="more-218"></span></p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m trying to copy a folder from my Windows XP SP2 Pro workstation onto my network share drive, which in fact is a samba (smb) server running on my &#8220;CentOS release 4.6 (Final)&#8221; box.</p>
<p>First thing to do is to check the error logs (generally) at &#8220;/var/log/samba&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<pre id="codemain" class="code">Sep  8 16:26:13 blade smbd[5913]: [2008/09/08 16:26:13, 0] lib/util_sock.c:read_data(534)

<p>Doesn&#8217;t seem very helpful&#8230;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t work out why I&#8217;m getting these errors, why is the peer being reset?</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/samba@lists.samba.org/msg91461.html">learned that the peer</a> is the client machine that the server is peering to, which means the problem is that my workstation is disconnecting me.</p>
<p>I checked my Event Viewer (%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc), which said:</p>
<blockquote><p>NetBT failed to process a request because it encountered OutOfResources exception(s) in the last 1 hour. Event ID: 4322</p></blockquote>
<p>I might have known that the problem would be with windows and not linux.</p>
<p>However, maybe I spoke too soon, as a quick search lands me on the <a href="http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2008-0711.html">redhat site</a>, which states:</p>
<blockquote><p>* when Windows® clients performed file operations on files stored on a<br />
Samba share, various error messages popped-up, and the &#8220;Event ID: 4322&#8221;<br />
error was logged on the Windows® clients:</p>
<p>NetBT failed to process a request because it encountered OutOfResources<br />
exception(s) in the last 1 hour.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which does describe the problem I&#8217;m having exactly, although i&#8217;ve only been experiencing this recently&#8230;</p>
<p>On the other hand the Microsoft site suggests I should <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc727761.aspx">Disable then Enable the network adapter</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>I tried this, and it appeared to work&#8230; At least for now&#8230;</p>
<p>Low and behold I soon got this error a short time later. Now what?</p>
<p>I decided to take a look into the <a href="https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4796">samba bug</a> mentioned above. Apparently the problem is seen in Samba 3.0.25 and 3.0.25a, but not Samba 3.0.24. I am running 3.0.25b-1.el4_6.5 (smbd &#8211;version).</p>
<p>After investigating my yum log (/var/log/yum.log) I see the following&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Jul 08 01:38:04 Updated: samba-common.i386 3.0.25b-1.el4_6.5<br />
Jul 08 01:39:11 Updated: samba.i386 3.0.25b-1.el4_6.5<br />
Jul 08 01:39:17 Updated: samba-client.i386 3.0.25b-1.el4_6.5</p></blockquote>
<p>This means that it&#8217;s not very likely to be that as I&#8217;ve been running it for more than two months, and i&#8217;ve only recently switched to this workstation (after an uber hardware failure).</p>
<p>I tried from another machine, and I can copy anything without seeing these errors&#8230; The plot thickens&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now convinced that the problem is with my workstation and not the server. Now what?</p>
<p>I <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/linux.samba/browse_thread/thread/3dca4ea0d4e7ef9a/9d9832a09a83ae54">noticed a thread by a guy</a> who mentioned that his machine (like mine) was up to date, SP2, but did not have IE7, unlike my other machines. This interested me. Maybe his <a href="https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4796">bug isn&#8217;t fixed</a> in the version I&#8217;m using? I think it is, it&#8217;s quite old&#8230;</p>
<p>However, it seems his solution was to upgrade to 3.0.25c and/or change the connection from &#8220;netbios-ssn&#8221; (port 139) to &#8220;microsoft-ds&#8221; (port 445)&#8230; somehow. I checked on both ends, and appears I&#8217;m already using &#8220;microsoft-ds&#8221; on this machine anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>Frustration is starting to kick in&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m out of ideas, perhaps I should roll back to an older version, see if that helps? My logs report this as been the previous version:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jun 07 17:01:55 Updated: samba-common.i386 3.0.10-1.4E.12.2<br />
Jun 07 17:04:29 Updated: samba-client.i386 3.0.10-1.4E.12.2<br />
Jun 07 17:07:44 Updated: samba.i386 3.0.10-1.4E.12.2</p></blockquote>
<p>I had second thoughts about this when reading the samba change log (rpm -q &#8211;changelog samba). There seems to be quite a few security fixes that I&#8217;d rather keep&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m totally out of ideas&#8230; &#8220;yum remove samba&#8221; it is&#8230; However, apparently to install an old version I have to first install a plugin called &#8220;yum-allowdowngrade&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is getting complicated, especially when it probably isn&#8217;t a problem with the server.</p>
<p>I decided to try an updated version instead&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>yum remove samba<br />
yum remove samba-common<br />
rpm -i http://charliebrady.org/samba/samba-common-3.0.30-0.i386.rpm</p>
<p>rpm -i ftp://ftp.pbone.net/mirror/www.startcom.org/AS-4.0.0/os/i386/StartCom/RPMS/perl-Convert-ASN1-0.18-3.noarch.rpm<br />
rpm -i http://charliebrady.org/samba/samba-3.0.30-0.i386.rpm<br />
service samba start</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s installed, and it started, however I appear to have lost my settings.</p>
<blockquote><p>mv /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.recent<br />
mv /etc/samba/smb.conf.rpmsave /etc/samba/smb.conf<br />
service smb restart</p></blockquote>
<p>Testing, and so far so good!</p>
<p>In summary, when I was convinced it was the silly windows based client workstation, instead it was the insanely overly complex linux server. This could all be avoided if redhat/centos wasn&#8217;t so keen on <a href="http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/backporting/?sc_cid=3093">backporting</a> and I had the latest version in the first place.</p>
<p>I look forward to the updates.</p>
