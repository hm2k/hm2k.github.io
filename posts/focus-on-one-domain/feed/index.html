					<description><![CDATA[Hey, I have a domain name that is related to a certain niche in only 1 state. There are 5 domains that are available that I would like to register. It is a small niche. The top person that is in google for the keyword I want only has 580 link backs. Each of the 5 domains has over 5,000 results when I search for the domain name.

All of the domains are not really &quot;main&quot; domains. Should I be just using all of these domains for only se results and pick another domain that just maybe has my company name and redirect all of these se domains to that domain?

I am just not sure what to do about having a bunch of domains that all want to goto the same place. I don&#039;t want to be banned by google or them thinking I am trying to spam the se or something.]]></description>
