										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about retiring this site for some time now, but have been toying with the pros and cons.</p>
<p>A decision had to be made.</p>
<p><span id="more-3017"></span></p>
<p>You see, the context of the HM2K blog has always had a subtle undertone of my business and the work I do online. That business is Phurix web hosting.</p>
<p>Phurix has always supported me and the blog, but unfortunately, because of other commitments I have less and less time to write and publish.</p>
<p>At first I thought the best solution would be to shut down the blog and call it a day, while a colleague said he thinks I should keep it online.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about a solution for a long time but then, while I was on holiday, it hit me.</p>
<p>Merge it into the Phurix brand and it made sense too:</p>
<ul>
<li>HM2K.com was a hard concept to explain</li>
<ul>
<li>Easier concept: Phurix Labs:&#8221;Where we experiment with ideas and findings&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<li>HM2K.com had no context, it would often seem random</li>
<ul>
<li>Makes more sense in the context of the business</li>
</ul>
<li>HM2K.com had no real focus or agenda</li>
<ul>
<li>Focus on what is important: the business</li>
</ul>
<li>HM2K.com was a burden on one person</li>
<ul>
<li>Shared with Phurix</li>
</ul>
<li>HM2K.com was not making money</li>
<ul>
<li>By improving brand awareness business will increase</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>A proposal was put forward and it went better than expected, it all seemed to fit together nicely. Perfect!</p>
<p>The decision was made and I have no regrets.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #444444; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: medium;">Today, we started by introducing a new &#8220;Phurix Labs&#8221; theme to HM2K.com, so that&#8217;s phase one is done.</span></p>
<p>Over the next few days, the website will be migrated from here to &#8220;labs.phurix.net&#8221; (where it now belongs). That&#8217;s phaze two.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you continue to support the new Phurix Labs project.</p>
<p>These are exciting times, watch this space!</p>
