<font style="color:#666; font-size:14;">In light of my post "<a href="http://www.hm2k.org/news/1133012808.html">Finally, a decent FTP client</a>", I am making a post about my findings with Windows FTP Deamon/Server software.<br /><br />I have tried a number of peices including:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.serv-u.com/">Serv-U</a> - Over the years I have used this quite a few times, I never really liked it, and it costs over $49.95. I'm going to look on...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pureftpd.org/">PureFTPD</a> - Although there is a win32 release, its difficult to work with, no easy way to configure your server, it does not run in the background without 3rd party software, even though it does have a tray icon, but all in all its fairly useless -- I couldn't even locate the config file. This thing is designed on and for Unix, not Windows, as I found.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.warftp.org/">warFTPD</a> - After much clicking around their website, I managed to actually download this software, only to be faced with a load more screens of clicking in the installation. The software installs to places you don't want it to, and it asks questions you don't really want to answer during installation. I decided to give this one a miss before the installation was over.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.gene6.com/">Gene6</a> - Its good, the trial only lasts 30 days though and it costs over £30, I just don't think its worth the price. Changing the port was difficult at first, but I figured you needed to add a domain first, and it worked, its a bit of an odd setup, but it worked.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.raidenftpd.com/">RaidenFTPd</a> - Costs over $19.95, however it was really really easy to setup. The problem was that the shareware splash screen was so annoying I could not seem to rid of it, it would not let me continue only quit, so I uninstalled it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.guildftpd.com/">guildFTPd</a> - This one was yet another dirty peice of software, hard to use and navigate, so much so you need to read their guide on it. I could not figure out how to change the port from 21 to another port. However it does turn out to uninstall very quickly and easily.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bpftpserver.com/">BPFTPd</a> - Apparently its based on the old Gene6, it has a 15 day trial. Costs $34.95.</font></td>
