<p><strong>How to fix against Blaster and Welchia viruses... </strong></p>
<p><em>Firstly are 
  you infected by one of these viruses?</em><br>
  Due to the nature of the viruses they mess around with the way windows acts, 
  so if you notice your computer is shutting down on its own, or when you go into 
  Add/Remove Programs (In Control Panel), or you go to your Windows directory 
(C:\Windows\) in explorer, and they don't look right, you are most likely infected.</p>
<p>Now, download the Fix Tools from the symantec anti virus web 
  site (<a href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/">http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/</a>)</p>
<p>Blaster: <a href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.blaster.worm.removal.tool.html">http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.blaster.worm.removal.tool.html</a><br>
FixBlast: <a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/FixBlast.exe">http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/FixBlast.exe</a></p>
<p>Welchia: <a href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.welchia.worm.removal.tool.html">http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.welchia.worm.removal.tool.html</a><br>
FixWelch: <a href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/FixWelch.exe">http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/FixWelch.exe</a></p>
<p>Run first the FixBlast Tool, and wait till its finished, afterwards 
  run the FixWelch tool, and wait till that has finished.</p>
<p>This will take some time... So while you are doing this, you 
  need to be downloading a firewall...</p>
<p>NOTE: If at this time your computer is wanted to shutdown windows, 
  use the command: 'shutdown -a' to abort the shutdown.</p>
<p>I recommend kerio personal firewall (<a href="http://www.kerio.com/us/kpf_download.html">http://www.kerio.com/us/kpf_download.html</a>)<br>
  KPF v2: <a href="http://www.kerio.com/dwn/kpf2-en-win.exe">http://www.kerio.com/dwn/kpf2-en-win.exe</a></p>
<p><em>NOTE: You don't need a firewall, but basically you'll be 
  attempting to get the windows updates before the virus gets you, not a risk 
  i'd like to take, besides you should always have a firewall anyway.</em></p>
<p>Now that you've downloaded the firewall, do not install it, 
  simply wait for the Fix Tools to finish.<br>
  Once the Fix Tools are finished and have removed any traces of viruses, restart 
  your computer.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: At this point you may wish to disconnect any internet 
  connection. (Either modem or ethernet cable)</em></p>
<p>When windows comes back on, simply install kerio personal firewall, 
  and restart.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: Reconnect your internet connection.</em></p>
<p>Once restarted, I recommend that you accept everything you use 
  on a regular bases,<br>
  apart from incoming ICMP's and connections via ports 135 and 445, which you 
  should permanently deny for all ips.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to start downloading the windows updates (<a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/</a>) 
  and simply follow the instructions.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: If your having trouble with windows updates (IE. there's 
  an error) it could be because your windows date/time is incorrect, it has to 
  be within 100 days of the real date/time to work correctly via the SSL connection 
  to the Windows Update site.</em></p>

<p>Restart as appropriate.</p>
<p>I can also recommend you install up-to-date anti virus software 
  such as Norton AntiVirus, and use the Live Updates to keep the virus definitions 
  up-to-date.</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: Don't let this happen again, use these 3 simple 
  tips, 1. Use a firewall, know what's connecting in and out of your computer 
  2. Keep windows up-to-date 3. Keep your virus definitions up-to-date</strong></em></p>
