					<description><![CDATA[I think detecting technologies is the purist solution.  Yes, we should do that if it is possible.  But technology tests are actually quite complicated to write and maintain as the years go by and layers of APIs and capabilities accrete on different browsers.  Also take into account that you&#039;ll need to deal with mobile devices hitting your pages too.  This complexity in determining capabilities with code running inside of several hundred different browser versions is terrible.  For me, I would go back to user agent detection used to look up capabilities from a database.  Do it on the server side before the page is rendered--not in client-side jscript.  WURFL has an impressive database of browsers and sophisticated matching to user agent.  Look at WURFL, maybe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey,

I would love to get a look at your script, I&#039;m having the same problem with my site and am going nuts trying to figure it out.. Does your script detect phone browsers &#038; screen resolution as well ?]]></description>
