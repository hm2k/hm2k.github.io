					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for doing the research.  The folks at a well known domain and hosting company
REALLY tried to get my business partner to register her domain name for 5 years or longer
based on SEO theory.  If you didn&#039;t do the research I would&#039;ve called Myth Busters!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My domain names fall into 2 categories:

1. Ideas, potential resale value
2. Domains which I am using for specific project

category 1 I usually do a 1-year registration
category 2 I always do 2-years and then automatically renew

you can always lengthen your contract, so it doesn&#039;t make much sense to pay for 5 years right off.  You might as well buy 1 or 2 year and then renew next year when the dollar is worth half as much :D]]></description>
