										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2007 I wrote about<a href="http://www.hm2k.com/posts/email-address-on-your-website"> email addresses on your website</a> and how to avoid putting your email address in plain text.</p>
<p>A guy I know, named &#8220;csarven&#8221; also wrote about <a href="http://www.csarven.ca/hiding-email-addresses">methods to hide email addresses from page source</a> providing over 16 concepts for hiding your email address.</p>
<p>This was useful, but not practical, so I decided to write a PHP class&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-1891"></span>I began writing the <a href="http://obfuscate.sourceforge.net/">Obfuscate Email PHP Library</a> as a proof of concept to show the various methods in action, but then I decided to release the code as well as a demonstration website.</p>
<p>The demonstration website is based on a concept outlined by tilllate.com in their &#8220;<a href="http://techblog.tilllate.com/2008/07/20/ten-methods-to-obfuscate-e-mail-addresses-compared/">nine ways to obfuscate e-mail addresses compared</a>&#8221; article.</p>
<p>In this article the author has setup 9 different email addresses and put them on their website using 9 different obfuscation techniques.</p>
<p>They then waited one and a half years for the mailboxes to receive emails and then reviewed the results.</p>
<p>The Obfuscate project is using a very similar concept, but instead it is using a free email service to provide disposable email addresses without any configuration.</p>
<p>At first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailinator">mailinator</a> was used, however emails are kept for just a few hours which makes it almost impossible to measure results. Meanwhile the <a href="http://www.dispostable.com/">dispostable</a> service keeps email for up to two days and there is no registration required.</p>
<p>The theory is that the &#8220;plain&#8221; email address should received more email than the others and the most successful methods will receive no emails at all.</p>
<p>The project website will be indexed by the search engines and the spam bots should start to crawl the website for email addresses.</p>
<p>Now we wait for the results&#8230;</p>
<p>In the meantime you can use the <a href="http://obfuscate.sourceforge.net/">Obfuscate Email PHP Library</a> to choose one of over 16 methods of obfuscation you feel is most suitable for you.</p>
