					<description><![CDATA[I have the same issue as you talked about here. I want to extract some photos from a .exe. The program used to create it is Firehand Lightning Max which is no longer supported. I tried the demo version of MultiExtractor to see what I would get before I paid for the full version. The only photo I could see was the first one on the disk and I couldn&#039;t click on it to make it big enough to check out the resolution. Do you have any suggestions?]]></description>
