Thanks Trevor, that&#039;s very useful, pretty much exactly what I&#039;m after based on your description.

I will check it out later today.

Thanks again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I played with Delicious Library but that does two things you don&#039;t want - commercial and Mac! But the problem with this (as with anything new, now), is that it would take me ages to input all my DVDs in to it. A site I have been using though is http://listal.com (http://trovster.listal.com) which like Delicious Library supports other formats not just DVD, which includes Games and CDs - both of which are useful to me. Listal also has a social aspect to it, although I rarely use it, which could be useful to find music/movies which are similar to your tastes.]]></description>
