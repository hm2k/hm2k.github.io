					<description><![CDATA[Another related SEO tip is for you to focus on one task at a time, especially if you are just doing all these things on your own. Value your time because that is also equivalent to money. 

But if you can, it is better to let professionals do it so you can have more time to come up with good strategies for your business while they are already working on your site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice Post, 

I never knew that image maps were ignored, I&#039;ve built a lot of my navigational around them, so I think I will need to go back to the drawing board and break the single image into individual images.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Its a shame about the image maps not being followed. With a site with lots and lots of banner content, it would be much nice on the client and the proxy server if one image served an accumulation of those banners on the left hand side, for example, as one image linked with an image map, as opposed to the client and server having to serve up 10-12 individual graphics each with links. Any news on google changing this so image maps can be followed? Good post, really concise.]]></description>
