    This script allows you using mIRC sockets to connect to CJB.NET and change your IP or URL assigned to your account, and you can even make it update to your own IP automaticly when you connect to IRC. Enjoy!</td>

    <td>Since <a href="http://smlnk.com/">smlnk</a> is no longer in use, I decided to change the script to work with <a href="http://lnks.us/">lnks.us</a> run by netmunky.<br>
    Basicly what lnks does, is convert a long URL such as http://this.is.a.really.really.really.really.really.really.really.really.long.url/ (if it exists) and it returns with a user friendly url like: http://lnks.us/?XXXXXXXX for more information, visit <a href="http://lnks.us/?info">http://lnks.us/?info</a>. This script basicly a frontend to the site, allowing you to manually or automaticly convert the urls either way.</td>
