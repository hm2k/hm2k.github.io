										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I decided to join <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>, which requires you to login using <a href="http://openid.net/get/">OpenID</a>.</p>
<p>It was pretty simple to get signed up with <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/">myopenid.com</a>, but while I was on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/login?returnurl=%2f">stackoverflow login page</a> I noticed a little message which I found interesting:<span id="more-408"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Use your own URL</h4>
<p>Want to add OpenID support to <em>your</em> website?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as easy as adding two HTML header tags!</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/using-your-own-url-as-your-openid/">Read more..</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It basically would mean I could use &#8220;hm2k.com&#8221; instead of &#8220;hm2k.myopenid.com&#8221; to login with OpenID, which is pretty neat. There&#8217;s also a section in the help on <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/help#own_domain">myOpenID.com for using your own domain</a>, which confirms this.</p>
<p>Seems easy enough, I thought. Then I took into consideration that I&#8217;m using wordpress, sure not a major problem, I can simply hard code it into my theme, but then do I really want to do that? No, of course not.</p>
<p>WordPress is renound for it&#8217;s ability to be compltely dynamic, I want to stick in line with that. More importantly, I want my OpenID URL to work regardless of what theme I&#8217;m using.</p>
<p>So I decided to start looking into it. I soon discovered someone over at wordpress.com had the same idea and had requested a way to <a href="http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/add-openid-delegation-link-to-head">add OpenID delegation link to head</a>.</p>
<p>At first I thought about getting a plugin that would inject the required lines of HTML into the head, however after some quite extensive research I found what I was looking for&#8230;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-409" title="OpenID Delegation" src="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/screenshot-5.png" alt="OpenID Delegation" width="550" height="141" srcset="https://hm2k.org/upload/screenshot-5.png 550w, https://hm2k.org/upload/screenshot-5-300x76.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/openid/">The WordPress OpenID Plugin</a> allows users authorized to use the OpenID Provider can delegate to a different provider, among other things.</p>
<p>Once you have installed and activated the plugin you need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the OpenID settings page (/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=openid)</li>
<li>Set the &#8220;Blog Owner&#8221; as yourself, and click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221;.</li>
<li>Go to your profile (/wp-admin/profile.php) and scroll to the bottom where it says &#8220;OpenID Delegation&#8221;.</li>
<li>In the edit box you would provide your OpenID URL (ie: http://hm2k.myopenid.com/)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now when I check the source code of my site I see the following HTML in the &lt;head&gt;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;link rel=&#8221;openid2.provider&#8221; href=&#8221;http://www.myopenid.com/server&#8221; /&gt;<br />
&lt;link rel=&#8221;openid2.local_id&#8221; href=&#8221;http://hm2k.myopenid.com/&#8221; /&gt;<br />
&lt;link rel=&#8221;openid.server&#8221; href=&#8221;http://www.myopenid.com/server&#8221; /&gt;<br />
&lt;link rel=&#8221;openid.delegate&#8221; href=&#8221;http://hm2k.myopenid.com/&#8221; /&gt;</p></blockquote>
<p>Perfect!</p>
<p>I hope you find this as useful as I have.</p>
