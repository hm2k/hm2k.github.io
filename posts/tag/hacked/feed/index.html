										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I noticed an unusual email when I checked my Gmail account today.</p>
<p>Sure it was spam, but this one was tagged with a &#8220;Password&#8221; tag, a tag that I used to filter any emails that contain an old password.</p>
<p>Low and behold there was my password displayed right in the email. So, of course, the first thing to do was to check the <a href="http://pastie.org/pastes/2003898/text">email headers</a> to see how the email was routed.</p>
<p>I could not believe it!<span id="more-2925"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>To: &#8220;password1&#8221; &lt;friendster@example.org&gt;</p>
<p><em>Note: my password is not password1, I replaced it with that.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>They had inserted my password instead of my name in the &#8220;To&#8221; part of the email headers.</p>
<p>The email address they sent to was an alias which I had used specifically for friendster so I knew. However, according to the email headers it definitely did not come from the friendster servers.</p>
<p>How did the spammers manage to get my password and email address?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve certainly not used the account since about 2005, so it can&#8217;t be me.</p>
<p>Does friendster store their passwords in plain text?</p>
<p>I figured the easiest way to check is to issue a &#8220;forgot password&#8221; request and see what happens.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s official: Friendster is a <a href="http://plaintextoffenders.com/">plain text offender</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I received an &#8220;<a href="http://pastie.org/pastes/2004005/text">Your Friendster account information</a>&#8221; email which contained my password in plain text right in the email.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/friendster-password.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2927" title="friendster password" src="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/friendster-password-300x213.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="213" srcset="https://hm2k.org/upload/friendster-password-300x213.jpg 300w, https://hm2k.org/upload/friendster-password.jpg 618w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, this means is that it is absolutely possible that if somebody <em>did </em>hack into friendster they could recover my password (and everyone elses) from their database.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for friendster?</strong></p>
<p>Well, probably not a lot since most people are waving <a href="http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/1972/bye-bye-friendster">bye-bye to friendster</a> anyway as friendster starts to delete all user data from their servers.</p>
<p><em>My tip: Don&#8217;t delay, <a href="http://www.friendster.com/cancelaccount.php">delete it today!</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Update 02/06/11</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday I emailed friendster to notify them of a serious security concern, today I received this reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank you for reporting this to us.  We take reports like this seriously  and we shall make the proper investigation on your concern.   Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t have a specific time frame on when the  investigation will be completed. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Customer Support</p></blockquote>
<p>P.S. Thanks for your comments, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not alone. Keep them coming!</p>
