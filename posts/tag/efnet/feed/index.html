										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday July 19 2009 Hardy announced on the <a href="http://www.efnet.org/">EFnet website</a> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Internet">Demon Internet</a> will be <a href="http://forum.efnet.org/viewtopic.php?t=2491">delinking efnet.demon.co.uk and hub.uk</a> from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFnet">EFnet IRC network</a> in August.</p>
<p>For me, it marks the end of an era. There are no more UK IRC servers on the EFnet IRC network.</p>
<p><span id="more-515"></span></p>
<p>Gone are those days that I remember back in 1998 when the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459">IRC protocol</a> was an important part of the internet for any ISP.</p>
<p>It seems that IRC for many people has been replaced by many other services such as Instant Messaging, Social Networks, Blogs and BitTorrent. Yet IRC is still here.</p>
<p>I have put the delink down to the fact that Demon can no longer justify the running costs of such a service in the current economic climate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a real sign of the times when Demon, one of the first commercial UK ISPs can no longer support a service it has been running for over 16 years.</p>
<p>Demon has become a household name through the sponsorship of the EFnet IRC server and has become a very reputable ISP because of it, especially to administrators.</p>
<p>Demon has not released any kind of announcement nor has it updated it&#8217;s site to reflect the change and as I am not a Demon customer they have refused to comment on the situation.</p>
<p>Is this the end for EFnet UK? or Is this the start of the <a href="http://irchelp.org/irchelp/networks/efnetsux.html">end for EFnet</a>?Â  I hope not&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to start making steps in the right direction and so I&#8217;ve setup a website and mailing list called <a href="http://www.efnet.org.uk/">EFnet UK</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to be part of EFnet UK, please join the <a href="http://efnet.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/efnetuk_efnet.org.uk">EFnet UK mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>EFnet needs a new sponsor for a UK IRC server and we need your help to get one. Maybe you can help.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Update 09/10/09:</strong> Multiplay is now sponsoring a new EFnet UK server. <a href="http://stats.efnet.org/servers/view/?sid=8&amp;show=motd">efnet.demon.co.uk</a> is dead, long live <a href="http://stats.efnet.org/servers/view/?sid=127&amp;show=motd">efnet.multiplay.co.uk</a>. Thanks goes to <a href="http://twitter.com/jamesoff">@JamesOff</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday marks the day that I took over the &#8220;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/cssbase/">cssbase</a>&#8221; project.</p>
<p><em>CSSbase</em> is a html and css base framework that has been developed to make web site development quicker and more efficient.</p>
<p>I hope to continue to maintain this project for all to use freely.</p>
<p><span id="more-512"></span></p>
<p>The project was started by <a href="http://nrgetik.com/">nrgetik</a>, however he <a href="http://www.dogsonacid.com/showthread.php?threadid=634218">passed away</a> on Sunday June 14, 2009. I didn&#8217;t know nrgetik that well on a personal level, but he was considered one of us in the webdev and css communities on EFnet. He was very much an integral part of our community and will be missed.</p>
<p>A while back I decided that I would like to take on this project and maintain it in his memory. I thought it would be best to let a little time pass before I muscled in and took over the project. I felt enough time had passed.</p>
<p>I contacted Google via their Hosting at Google Code Group, I asked the question &#8220;<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-code-hosting/browse_thread/thread/4d6061b1c73cbe1b">What do you do if the project owner dies?</a>&#8221; and after a bumpy start I was eventually in touch with a very helpful Google employee, who assisted me with the project transfer.</p>
<p>The project is now in my ownership and I will continue to maintain it in his memory.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is for you good buddy!</p></blockquote>
<p>Please help to test and give useful and helpful feedback to improve it. As nrgetik would have wanted it.</p>
<p>If you like the sound of this project, use it, or would like to get involved, let me know!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, my botnet is pretty lame, but it&#8217;s also kinda cool. I&#8217;m not talking about anything bad though.</p>
<p>My botnet is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggdrop">eggdrop</a> botnet that I use on the <a href="http://www.efnet.org/">EFnet</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a> network and it runs a script I called &#8220;lame&#8221;.</p>
<p><span id="more-491"></span></p>
<p>The script my botnet uses written in <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">tcl</a> was originally created by unknownd, but has since stopped development.</p>
<p>I know that he stopped development because not only did I speak to him before he quit IRC, but <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://unknownd.daer.net/">all</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://home.no.net/unknownd/">his</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/www.unknownd.net">sites</a> are no longer available.</p>
<blockquote><p>UnKnownD &#8211; unknownd@dialdown.the.switch.uten.net parted #serialz on October 3 2001 2:24:31pm</p></blockquote>
<p>The script was originally called &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=harry.tcl">harry.tcl</a>&#8220;, but it had a <a href="http://forum.egghelp.org/viewtopic.php?p=80267">few bugs</a>, so I decided to fix them and call it lame.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s a fantastic script, but what I had was pretty lame, as it was just a hacked up version of someone else&#8217;s script but I only used it for my own personal botnet, so it didn&#8217;t really matter.</p>
<p>However, I now realise that it is actually better than the original <em>harry.tcl</em> because of the bugs I have fixed and the tweaks I added.</p>
<p>A few people over the years have shown a little interest in my botnet script, so I think it&#8217;s about time that I released it.</p>
<p><em>So where do I get the goodies?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve setup a project hosting on Google Code as &#8220;<a href="http://lamebotnet.googlecode.com/">lamebotnet</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no &#8220;release&#8221; as such yet, but you can get the files you need <a href="http://lamebotnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/">here</a>, you only need to really follow the instructions in the<a href="http://lamebotnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/readme.txt"> readme</a> file.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to configure your &#8220;<a href="http://lamebotnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/botnet">botnet</a>&#8221; file, otherwise your bots won&#8217;t know where to connect.</p>
<p>I am aware that by releasing the script I may make myself more vulnerable to exploitation and people may <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lamebotnet/issues/list">point out issues or bugs</a> I wasn&#8217;t aware of, but hey, I&#8217;m all for improvement and look forward to fixing them.</p>
<p>Of course, this is assuming there even are any issues, there may not be, I&#8217;ve run this since about 2001 and had no major issues yet, so my hopes are pretty high.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>PS. Think of your own naming scheme for your botnet, I&#8217;m already using the muppets!</em></p>
