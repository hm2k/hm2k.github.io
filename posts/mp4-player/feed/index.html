					<description><![CDATA[All the brand less MP4 players with build in memory are part of a big scam.
But always be aware that you complain atleast before 45 days. So you can get your money back with pay-pal.

I had bought an 8GB player turned out to be an 2GB player.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I am a reseller and as I have started this business recently, I was not aware of such a big fraud on ebay. I had purchased nearly 100-150 players, worth $3000.00, on ebay, and was very happy to have such a good dealson ebay. I was feeling very proud of myself that I took this decision, now I will double my money by selling all the players in a local market!!!!! First of all I didn&#039;t receive all the players as it was a Christmas time ad due to overload on HongKong Post many players were misplaced and could not reach till me,  though the seller had mentioned 25-30 days as a delivery time, I waited for 45-50 days, then opened cases in paypal for refund, few of the cases were opened in ebay(10-15 out of 150) And one bad morning when I was trying to log in to my ebay account, I show the ebay message on first page that my account was suspended due to over use of ebay resolution centre!!!!!!!! I was shcked. Mean time I tried to sell the players I had received but almost all the players came back to me because of malfunction and hacked memory. I have nearly 60 players lying with me as a Junk and that Junk cost me around 1500-2000$(total loss of my investment and my dream to earn money on Ebay) Can some one forward this message to ebay. Can i request ebay to take back all the players from me and pay me back my actual invested money on that (does this fit in your Buyers protection Policies!!!!!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Video Format

I bought one years ago on eBay and it came with a mini CD that has a program that will format video so that it works in the mp4 player. None of the standard formats work

Unlike everyone above, mine works fine and, once I got used to the control &#039;wheel&#039; I was able to use it. It was only listed as 1GB and worked well with XP. I now have Vista but have not tried/ used it for a year. I also read pages on the web that advised not to upgrade firmware so I haven&#039;t.]]></description>
