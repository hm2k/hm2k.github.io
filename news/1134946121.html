<font style="color:#666; font-size:14;">My company (and myself) have been using Paypal for means of payment for well over 2 years now, yet it seems that Paypal sucks more than ever.<br /><br />Recently my company had an order from someone, the payment came through, but the order looked dodgy (you can always tell the dodgy ones, yahoo.com/hotmail.com email addresses, country on the postal address does not match the location of the IP address, or the IP address is on AOL, the name on the account does not match the name of the paypal account, etc), so the payment came through, it was a yearly fee, we didn't set it up as it was obviously fraud, and no doubt someone in a couple of days time will realise and simply issue a charge back.<br /><br />However in this case, the guy complained to us and said he had made no order of this kind, as expected, but when he complained to paypal, he said he had not received the service he had paid for, rather than simply issuing a charge back.<br /><br />In turn, paypal have decided to disable our account, and we have spent the last 17 days trying to resolve the issue(s), and get our account reactivated.<br /><br />It has been a NIGHTMARE, and we cannot receive payments (about 90% of our payments ARE paypal) until the issue is resolved.<br /><br />This brings me onto my next note...<br /><br /><a href="http://paypalsucks.org/"><img style="border: none;" alt="" src="http://www.hm2k.org/news/data/upimages/PPS-Cartoon1.gif" /></a><br /><br />Cartoon by <a href="http://paypalsucks.org/">PayPalSucks.org</a><br /><br />Try and avoid using paypal where possible, try alternatives such as <a href="http://www.nochex.com/">nochex</a></font></td>
