<font style="color:#666; font-size:14;">I forgot to post this new feature on Google that I was informed about.<br /><br />So here it is...<br /><br /> <blockquote><div style="font-size: 13px;">quote:</div><hr style="border: 1px solid #ACA899;" /><div>It may come as no surprise, but I like to search for things on Google. Yep, when I'm looking for something, I always try it on Google first. And sometimes, that thing I'm looking for is music. Many of our users feel the same way, and we get a lot of search traffic on music terms like popular artists and albums.<br /><br />A few of us decided to try to make the information you get for these searches even better, so we created a music search feature. Now you can search for a popular artist name, like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=the+beatles">the Beatles</a> or the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pixies">Pixies</a>, and often Google will show some information about that artist, like cover art, reviews, and links to stores where you can download the track or buy a CD via a link at the top of your web search results page.<br /><br />We do this sort of thing a lot -- adding a bit of special information to results for important searches. For example, we have <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=king+kong++movie&btnG=Search">movie showtimes</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=goog&btnG=Search">stock quotes</a>. The more information we can make easily accessible with a simple search, the better.<br /><br />Right now the music search feature mostly works for artists popular in the U.S. and a more limited number of artists from other countries, but we plan to expand it to classical music, worldwide artists, and lesser-known performers. Our list of music stores will also grow over time. If you’re a music store (selling downloads, music by subscription, or physical CDs) and would like to be listed, <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/request.py">please get in touch</a>.<br /><br />You might be thinking,"why can't I just type in an album name or a song name and get the same music search results?” There are many album names and songs which are also plain English words. Sometimes users are looking for music information related to those words, and sometimes they aren’t. As we get better at knowing when our users want music information, we hope to expand this feature to include more queries. So keep searching, and we hope you'll be pleasantly surprised with the results. We always welcome your <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/request.py">feedback</a>.</div><hr style="border: 1px solid #ACA899;" /></blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/searching-for-music.html">Source</a></font></td>
