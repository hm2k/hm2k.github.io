				<div class="postentry">
									<p>I was recently informed that my <em>old </em>laptop, a HP Pavilion ze4111s, (now being used by my girlfriend) that “it doesn’t charge”, which then changed to “it sometimes does, and other times it doesn’t”.</p>
<p>I decided to investigate and began wiggling the AC adaptor at the back in the DC jack socket, which appeared to become lose.</p>
<p>My next idea was to take the laptop apart to take a closer look at the DC jack to see where the problem lay.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was to find the service and maintenance manual on the manufacturers website. I managed to locate the <a href="http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c00246219.pdf">Service and Maintenance manual for the HP Pavilion 4100 series</a> in PDF form, this document can be used for many other laptops as they are all built in a very similar way.</p>
<p>I began following the instructions for “removing the motherboard”, which requires following the instructions for removing other parts first. This is a long process, and can take some time.</p>
<p>To make sure I knew which screws were for what and where, I took a few empty egg boxes, and labelled them as I put the screws in. This will make it easier to locate the right screws when I reassemble the laptop.</p>
<p>After spending some time to get to the motherboard and safely remove it, low and behold the connector had come away from the motherboard, but was sometimes still touching hence why sometimes it worked and other times it did not.</p>
<p>I also discovered that the housing had cracked, and with a little wiggle the top came off, and I could now see the exact problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/dsc_0011-large.JPG" title="HP Pavilion ze4111s broken DC jack"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/dsc_0011-large.JPG" title="HP Pavilion ze4111s broken DC jack"><img src="https://www.hm2k.com/upload/dsc_0011-large.thumbnail.JPG" alt="HP Pavilion ze4111s broken DC jack"></a></p>
<p>My next step was to work out what to do next with this laptop. This laptop is quite old, and is most definitely outside its warranty period. However I knew what the problem was and had a few ideas on how to fix it.</p>
<p>I decided to contact HP for their suggestions, and while I waited I searched eBay for a supplier of parts for the ze4111s, I located a company who had some parts. I contacted them about getting a replacement motherboard for the laptop, and they suggested that the replacement would be £60. To me that is excessive, probably about 1/3 of the total value of the laptop, it’s not worth it.</p>
<p>I finally got hold of someone at HP, who suggested I contact a service centre, who I found out, charge an absolute fortune! I explained to them that it would not be worth my while and besides I know what the problem is.</p>
<p>I tried resoldering the connector from the housing of the DC jack to the motherboard, but the moment I put the AC adapter into the DC jack the housing would break and force the connection to break.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/dsc_0015-large.JPG" title="HP Pavilion ze4111s broken DC jack resolder"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/dsc_0015-large.JPG" title="HP Pavilion ze4111s broken DC jack resolder"><img src="https://www.hm2k.com/upload/dsc_0015-large.thumbnail.JPG" alt="HP Pavilion ze4111s broken DC jack resolder"></a></p>
<p>Upon further examining the motherboard, I discovered that the jack could be safely removed from the motherboard providing I could unsolder it from the underneath where it connects to the motherboard in three places. Not a problem, I’d just require a replacement jack.</p>
<p>I went on to explain this to the HP contact, who provided me with the following details:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would like to inform you that as per <span id="st" name="st" class="st">HP</span> policies if the issue is with<br>
power jack then you have to replace the motherboard. However, for your<br>
information I would like to say that the Power Jack on some Notebook<br>
models can be replaced. So, please visit the following Web site to to<br>
know more information about the power jack on the Notebook:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.compaqrepair.com/guide/Compaq_motherboard_ac_power_jacks.htm" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">http://www.compaqrepair.com<wbr></wbr>/guide/Compaq_motherboard_ac<wbr></wbr>_power_jacks.htm</a></p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><a href="http://www.laptopjacks.com/service.php" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">http://www.laptopjacks.com<wbr></wbr>/service.php</a></p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aacomputerelec.com/categories.asp?cat=8" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">http://www.aacomputerelec.com<wbr></wbr>/categories.asp?cat=8</a></p>
<p>NOTE:  The URLs above will take you to a non <span id="st" name="st" class="st">HP</span> Web site.  <span id="st" name="st" class="st">HP</span> does<br>
not control and is not responsible for information outside<br>
of the <span id="st" name="st" class="st">HP</span> Web site.</p>
<p>Once you visit the We site, contact support of the web site and check<br>
for the availability of the power jack for your model.</p>
<p>Then take the notebook to nearest Local Service Center and get the power<br>
jack replaced.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was most helpful, I discovered that clearly it can be done, and there are replacements out there!</p>
<p>I also found <a href="http://hardware.mcse.ms/printthread.php?s=03f0956cc2aa5b714d13a970cab34127&amp;threadid=138856&amp;perpage=10&amp;pagenumber=21">this thread</a>, and figured that if this guy could do it, I could do it too.</p>
<p>I found that the sites above were charging a fortune for the replacement jack, so I checked all my usual suppliers for components including Maplin, no such luck.</p>
<p>Then, a brainwave, I could cross reference google with eBay and see if anyone had mentioned a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Aebay.co.uk+%2Bze4111s+%2Bjack&amp;btnG=Search">jack for a ze4111s</a> recently. So that’s what I did, and soon discovered the seller “<a href="http://feedback.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback&amp;userid=laptop18000">laptop18000</a>“, and their shop “<a href="http://stores.ebay.co.uk/GOOD-DEALS-IN">GOOD DEALS IN</a>” based in the USA, but sells DC jacks for laptops for very cheap compared to the previous offers.</p>

<p align="center"><em>“Sounds good to me!”</em></p>
<p>From here its simply a case of de-soldering the old connector from the motherboard, soldering the new connector, then putting the laptop back together. Problem solved!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the laptop remains in pieces…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/dsc_0038-medium.JPG" title="HP Pavilion ze4111s"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/dsc_0038-medium.JPG" title="HP Pavilion ze4111s"><img src="https://www.hm2k.com/upload/dsc_0038-medium.thumbnail.JPG" alt="HP Pavilion ze4111s"></a></p>
<p>In conclusion, don’t throw your laptop away, don’t pay excessive amounts getting someone autherised by HP to fix it, don’t pay more than you have to. DO IT YOURSELF!</p>

									<p>I bought this on the 20/08/04 for £179.99, which actually seems quite a lot for such a phone, but it was not bad at the time for a brand new unlocked phone.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/cx65.jpg" title="Siemens CX65 Mobile Phone"><img src="https://www.hm2k.com/upload/cx65.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Siemens CX65 Mobile Phone"></a></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/cx65.jpg" title="Siemens CX65"></a></p>
<p>I decided to get this phone as I had a Siemens ME45 before and that was great for it’s time.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this phone had a very stylish design. It was one of few non-flip phones on the market as they appeared to be becoming the norm. I have always been under the impression that like small convertibles, they are girlie.</p>
<p>The features I particularly liked when I purchased this phone were the custom polyphonic ring tones, vibrate, IRDA, build-in camera for photos and video, navigation joystick, integrated antenna, loudspeaker, “dynamic lights” for alerts, full colour display, video playback, silent mode and the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook.</p>
<p>At the time of it’s release cameras were begining to become established in phones and were now the standard, as such this phone even came with an optional flash which plugged into the bottom. Quality of photos and video is reasonable.</p>
<p>Obviously it also came with standard features such as SMS, MMS and Internet/WAP, oh and of course the ability to make  and receive calls.</p>
<p>As you can tell, this phone is pretty feature-tastic, the only thing it is missing from it’s elegant design is bluetooth. To begin with this didn’t matter as no one had bluetooth either, but as more and more phones came with bluetooth as standard, this phone got left behind.</p>
<p>Regardless, this is a fantastic phone. One of the best things is the navigation. Finding anything was easy, and once you were in it, it was easy to use. Text messages supported T9, which was really simple to work with, compared to other phones.</p>
<p>I also loved the management options such as copy and paste, and the phone number highlighting so you can dial a number you are sent with ease.</p>
<p>One of my favorite features was the dynamic lights. These are used when you receive a missed call or a text message to continually alert you that you have to attend to it, without continuously releasing a distressing noise like other phones, otherwise known as silent alerts. You are able to turn off the dynamic lights feature.</p>
<p>This phone also comes with some useful applications such as calculator (which is difficult to use), calendar, notes, task, dictating, stop watch, count down, unit converter, alarm clock, media player and all sorts of other software functions I would probably never get around to using, but at least I know they are there.</p>
<p>Another great feature of this phone was its ability to run java. This meant you could easily get hold of, and install new applications and new games to extend the possibilities of this phone.</p>
<p>Although this phone has quite a bit of storage space, for some strange reason, it could only seem to manage 100 text messages on the phone, and the standard 10 on the sim card. I never worked that out.</p>
<p>One thing I did find useful, was the ability to sync with outlook. Although to begin with the software that came with the phone wasn’t very good, Siemens released new software which was far better. Also the data connection was serial not USB, this meant your power was drained very quickly.</p>
<p>The benefit of this though was that I was able to use <a href="http://www.hendrik-sattler.de/scmxx/">SCMxx</a>, which is command line based communication software which I used for sending text messages from my computer without having to type with my thumb on my phone or use bulky software.</p>
<p>However, I think this is going to be the last Siemens I buy, and is almost definately the last of its kind, as on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4616515.stm">07/06/05 Siemens AG (Siemens Mobile) announced it was being bought by BenQ (formerly Acer)</a>, but it all spells trouble for me, and as far as I can see it is a struggling company, and is having difficulty competing in today’s market. It is only a matter of time before its is bankrupt.</p>
<p>Conclusion: This was a great phone and simply lacked bluetooth, it’s time to move on.</p>

									<p>Today I had the joy of fixing an Epson Stylus C46 UX printer.</p>
<p>It had the following error: “Parts inside your printer are at the end of their service life. See your printer documentation.”</p>
<p>After a little searching I discovered that most people were saying that “It is simply not worth repairing”, however, I took that as a challange, and decided that if I was going to throw it away anyway I might as well try to fix it first.</p>
<p>Before long I located a page on <a href="http://www.fixyourownprinter.com/forums/inkjet/14116">fixyourownprinter.com</a>‘s forum, which had plenty of details about similar issues.</p>
<p>This is the process I used after reading details on that page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unplug the power and USB cables from the printer.</li>
<li>Prepare your work area by putting scrap paper down. Have some spare, just incase. You may also require tissue paper. It is also recommended you use protective gloves as the ink will stain your skin for quite some time.</li>
<li>Unscrew the screw at the back of the printer.</li>
<li>There are two or three tabs at the back and two at the front. Gently push them in, and then using a bit of force pry apart the cover.</li>
<li>At the back of the unit you need to locate some white pads, or sponge type things, initially they will seem fine, but they will infact be full of ink. You need to grab a pair of pliers and pull them out one by one, there should be four, put them on your scrap paper.</li>
<li>Take the scrap paper with the pads on to your sink, turn on the hot tap and hold each one under the tap using the pliers until the water runs clear. If you have protective gloves on it may be worth squeezing the water out also.</li>
<li>It is recommended that once you have done this, you let them dry.</li>
<li>Now return the pads back into the printer.</li>
<li>Put the printer back together, (mind out for the paper alignment, and give it some force), not forgetting the screw at the back.</li>
<li>Plug in the USB and power cable and turned it ON. (Yes the lights will still flash)</li>
<li>Download and install the <a href="http://www.ssclg.com/epsone.shtml">SSC Service Utility for Epson Stylus Printers</a>.</li>
<li> Select your printer and model number (There is no Stylus C42 UX, so select Stylus C4x), then close the window.</li>
<li>If it asks if you replaced with the pads; say “YES”. Then close the window.</li>
<li>You will see a SSC Service Utilitiy icon (it looks like a printer) in the system tray (next to your click), and LEFT click.</li>
<li>A menu will appear, from here you can click on “Protection counter” (its a red cross), then “reset protection counter”.</li>
<li>Turn the printer power OFF, wait 10 seconds and then turn it back ON.</li>
</ol>
<p>Done!</p>
<p><em>Additional troubleshooting… </em></p>
<p>If you have problems with paper feed, take it apart again, check everything is in place correctly, push things together tightly, and put it together again.</p>
<p>If you have trouble with print quality, open the lid, clean any ink residue, use the SSC Service Utilitiy to clean the heads.</p>

									<p>Just before Christmas, I decided I was going to get an MP3 player for my girlfriend as she wanted a new mp3-player, as her 40gb one was too much and now old, so she was looking for something with around 4gb or 8gb of storage space.<br>
A friend suggested there were tuns of 4GB MP4 Players on ebay, I questioned him and said, I wonder why they are going so cheap, his reply was thats because there are so many. I figured something wasn’t quite right, but as the sellers had over 98.99% positive feedback I figured it seemed like a half decent deal.</p>
