										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I keep getting this error:</p>
<blockquote><p>Error Copying File or Folder</p>
<p>Cannot copy xxx: The specified network name is no longer available.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><span id="more-218"></span></p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m trying to copy a folder from my Windows XP SP2 Pro workstation onto my network share drive, which in fact is a samba (smb) server running on my &#8220;CentOS release 4.6 (Final)&#8221; box.</p>
<p>First thing to do is to check the error logs (generally) at &#8220;/var/log/samba&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<pre id="codemain" class="code">Sep  8 16:26:13 blade smbd[5913]: [2008/09/08 16:26:13, 0] lib/util_sock.c:read_data(534)

<p>Doesn&#8217;t seem very helpful&#8230;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t work out why I&#8217;m getting these errors, why is the peer being reset?</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/samba@lists.samba.org/msg91461.html">learned that the peer</a> is the client machine that the server is peering to, which means the problem is that my workstation is disconnecting me.</p>
<p>I checked my Event Viewer (%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc), which said:</p>
<blockquote><p>NetBT failed to process a request because it encountered OutOfResources exception(s) in the last 1 hour. Event ID: 4322</p></blockquote>
<p>I might have known that the problem would be with windows and not linux.</p>
<p>However, maybe I spoke too soon, as a quick search lands me on the <a href="http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2008-0711.html">redhat site</a>, which states:</p>
<blockquote><p>* when Windows® clients performed file operations on files stored on a<br />
Samba share, various error messages popped-up, and the &#8220;Event ID: 4322&#8221;<br />
error was logged on the Windows® clients:</p>
<p>NetBT failed to process a request because it encountered OutOfResources<br />
exception(s) in the last 1 hour.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which does describe the problem I&#8217;m having exactly, although i&#8217;ve only been experiencing this recently&#8230;</p>
<p>On the other hand the Microsoft site suggests I should <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc727761.aspx">Disable then Enable the network adapter</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>I tried this, and it appeared to work&#8230; At least for now&#8230;</p>
<p>Low and behold I soon got this error a short time later. Now what?</p>
<p>I decided to take a look into the <a href="https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4796">samba bug</a> mentioned above. Apparently the problem is seen in Samba 3.0.25 and 3.0.25a, but not Samba 3.0.24. I am running 3.0.25b-1.el4_6.5 (smbd &#8211;version).</p>
<p>After investigating my yum log (/var/log/yum.log) I see the following&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Jul 08 01:38:04 Updated: samba-common.i386 3.0.25b-1.el4_6.5<br />
Jul 08 01:39:11 Updated: samba.i386 3.0.25b-1.el4_6.5<br />
Jul 08 01:39:17 Updated: samba-client.i386 3.0.25b-1.el4_6.5</p></blockquote>
<p>This means that it&#8217;s not very likely to be that as I&#8217;ve been running it for more than two months, and i&#8217;ve only recently switched to this workstation (after an uber hardware failure).</p>
<p>I tried from another machine, and I can copy anything without seeing these errors&#8230; The plot thickens&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now convinced that the problem is with my workstation and not the server. Now what?</p>
<p>I <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/linux.samba/browse_thread/thread/3dca4ea0d4e7ef9a/9d9832a09a83ae54">noticed a thread by a guy</a> who mentioned that his machine (like mine) was up to date, SP2, but did not have IE7, unlike my other machines. This interested me. Maybe his <a href="https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4796">bug isn&#8217;t fixed</a> in the version I&#8217;m using? I think it is, it&#8217;s quite old&#8230;</p>
<p>However, it seems his solution was to upgrade to 3.0.25c and/or change the connection from &#8220;netbios-ssn&#8221; (port 139) to &#8220;microsoft-ds&#8221; (port 445)&#8230; somehow. I checked on both ends, and appears I&#8217;m already using &#8220;microsoft-ds&#8221; on this machine anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>Frustration is starting to kick in&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m out of ideas, perhaps I should roll back to an older version, see if that helps? My logs report this as been the previous version:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jun 07 17:01:55 Updated: samba-common.i386 3.0.10-1.4E.12.2<br />
Jun 07 17:04:29 Updated: samba-client.i386 3.0.10-1.4E.12.2<br />
Jun 07 17:07:44 Updated: samba.i386 3.0.10-1.4E.12.2</p></blockquote>
<p>I had second thoughts about this when reading the samba change log (rpm -q &#8211;changelog samba). There seems to be quite a few security fixes that I&#8217;d rather keep&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m totally out of ideas&#8230; &#8220;yum remove samba&#8221; it is&#8230; However, apparently to install an old version I have to first install a plugin called &#8220;yum-allowdowngrade&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is getting complicated, especially when it probably isn&#8217;t a problem with the server.</p>
<p>I decided to try an updated version instead&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>yum remove samba<br />
yum remove samba-common<br />
rpm -i http://charliebrady.org/samba/samba-common-3.0.30-0.i386.rpm</p>
<p>rpm -i ftp://ftp.pbone.net/mirror/www.startcom.org/AS-4.0.0/os/i386/StartCom/RPMS/perl-Convert-ASN1-0.18-3.noarch.rpm<br />
rpm -i http://charliebrady.org/samba/samba-3.0.30-0.i386.rpm<br />
service samba start</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s installed, and it started, however I appear to have lost my settings.</p>
<blockquote><p>mv /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.recent<br />
mv /etc/samba/smb.conf.rpmsave /etc/samba/smb.conf<br />
service smb restart</p></blockquote>
<p>Testing, and so far so good!</p>
<p>In summary, when I was convinced it was the silly windows based client workstation, instead it was the insanely overly complex linux server. This could all be avoided if redhat/centos wasn&#8217;t so keen on <a href="http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/backporting/?sc_cid=3093">backporting</a> and I had the latest version in the first place.</p>
<p>I look forward to the updates.</p>
