										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days I find myself buying all sorts of things off of ebay.</p>
<p>The problem I have found in the past is that I cannot keep track of the items I am bidding on, and then forget about them, consequently ending up with nothing.<br />
I set out to find a FREE method of tracking eBay auctions. An application that allows you to snipe would be good too.</p>
<p>My first port of call was freshmeat.net, where I found:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bidnobble.com/">BidNobble</a> &#8211; This piece of software looked great, however I soon find out that it doesn&#8217;t actually work correctly.</li>
<li><a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/ebayagent/">eBay Agent</a> &#8211; This was a nice application written in Perl, which could be run from a server however with no decent frontend.</li>
<li><a href="http://bidwatcher.sourceforge.net/">bidwatcher</a> &#8211; This application was okay, the problem was it was slow, and this didn&#8217;t work properly either.</li>
<li><a href="http://pedram.redhive.com/blog/">Bid Monkey</a> &#8211; Written in python, I tried this, I didn&#8217;t like it at all.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jbidwatcher.com/">JBidwatcher</a> &#8211; Another java based Bit watcher, that is very poorly designed, and difficult to work with.</li>
</ul>
<p>I crawled the internet for other applications out there, only to find they don&#8217;t REALLY exist.</p>
<p>In the end the best thing I found was a Google Gadget for Google Desktop called <a href="http://desktop.google.com/plugins/i/auctionwatch.html?hl=en">eBay Auction Watch</a>. This plug-in is fantastic, its just a shame you&#8217;re forced to use it with Google Desktop considering it uses so much system resources.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just before Christmas, I decided I was going to get an MP3 player for my girlfriend as she wanted a new mp3-player, as her 40gb one was too much and now old, so she was looking for something with around 4gb or 8gb of storage space.<br />
A friend suggested there were tuns of 4GB MP4 Players on ebay, I questioned him and said, I wonder why they are going so cheap, his reply was thats because there are so many. I figured something wasn&#8217;t quite right, but as the sellers had over 98.99% positive feedback I figured it seemed like a half decent deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/templatemp4z054gb.jpg" class="imagelink" title="Mp4 Player from eBay ugoole/e-britain"><span id="more-30"></span><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/templatemp4z054gb.jpg" id="image31" alt="Mp4 Player from eBay ugoole/e-britain" height="187" width="368" /></a></p>
<p>The MP4 Players I was looking at were comparable to the Apple iPod nano in appearance, I knew they wouldn&#8217;t function in the same way, but these offered way more features and were far cheaper than a nano.</p>
<p>So I spent some time bidding on quite a few of these mp4 players, making sure I wasn&#8217;t paying over the odds to get one, as there were simply loads on ebay, it was silly to try and outbid other people. They were going for between £28 and £40, I was going for £34 max.<br />
Eventually I ended up with 3, two (1xBlack, 1xPink) came from one seller (e-britain), one (1xBlack) came from another (ugoole).</p>
<p>So I ended up with 2 too many, I decided to keep a black one for myself, wrap the pink one for my girlfriend, and then wrap the spare black one for my dad (I figured he&#8217;d work it out eventually). I also wrapped mine up, so my girlfriend wouldn&#8217;t suspect what I had got her for Christmas, as I knew I couldn&#8217;t keep my hands off it.</p>
<p>Note: At this point I have not left feedback for my items, as I know I had not fully tested them.</p>
<p>Christmas comes and goes, all is well. My girlfriend asks me to put some music on her mp4 player, which we do by spending a long time looking through my 80gb external hard drive. We collect 4gb of music she wants to listen to and place it onto the device.</p>
<p>She goes home. The next thing I know and she&#8217;s on the phone to me complaining about how she can&#8217;t play some of her music and it seems corrupt in some way. She brings it around the following day and I check it out, and try new music on the device.</p>
<p>After some playing around I realise that anything over about 1gb of media and the data is corrupt. I send her away and begin my research.</p>
<p>I took upon me the impossible challenge of trying to work out who the manufacturer of the devices are. I checked all the firmware on the device, nothing, so I check the software that comes with it.</p>
<p>I run the MP3 Player Upgrade Tool (&#8220;C:\Program Files\MP3 Player Utilities 4.00\RDiskUpdate\RdiskUpdate.exe&#8221;), and low and behold the device name and manufacturer is there.</p>
<blockquote><p>Device Name: S1 MP3 Player</p>
<p>Productor: Wilson Co. Ltd.</p>
<p>Version: 9.0.43</p></blockquote>
<p>With these details I soon found a page in the Wikipedia entitled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S1_MP3_Player">S1 MP3 Player</a>. The Mp3 player displayed here was nothing like the mp4 player I had, I figured they just forgot to update the details in the software I have.</p>
<p>Also I managed to locate the Wilson Co. Ltd. Website, which appears to be down or no longer exists as it did, however through the powers of the internet I am able to use the web archive and view a previous version of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.wilson168.com/">Wilson Co. Ltd.</a> website. To no major benefit, the website contains limited details, and clearly the products are no longer supported.</p>
<p>I go back to the wikipedia page, and find the <a href="http://forum.s1mp3.org/">S1mp3.org forum</a>. A quick search on there and I soon find a <a href="http://forum.s1mp3.org/viewtopic.php?t=5073">thread</a> where people are experiencing the same issues as me.<br />
So just by chance I decide to do a bit of research based on the ebay sellers, to see if I can find where these items came from and what the deal is here.</p>
<p>All the images they use on the ebay auctions are hosted on <a href="http://www.store724.com/">store724.com</a> which when I visit brings up details about <a href="http://www.tronfydirect.com/">tronfydirect.com</a>.</p>
<p>A quick google search for tronfydirect.com brings up details of ebuyhk.com, i&#8217;ve also seen the username ebayhk on ebay quite a few times in the past. A quick search for ebayhk.com very quickly brings up a few references including <a href="http://www.maskpay.com/">maskpay.com</a> which is VERY dodgy. However, I will leave that for this time as this goes beyond my concern.</p>
<p>I also searched for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=tronfy.com&amp;btnG=Search">tronfy.com</a>, which brings up details of <a href="http://www.tronfy.com/techsupport/">downloads for mp3/mp4 players</a> and an <a href="http://tronfy.com/techsupport/FQA.html">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>After looking at my paypal transactions again I discover the company is &#8220;Tronfy Technology Co. LTD.&#8221;, the domain&#8217;s whois details the following names: &#8220;<a href="mailto:tronfydirectcom@yahoo.com">Tsing Yi</a>, David Chen and <a href="mailto:ruihong.c@gmail.com">Ruihong Chen</a>&#8221; at the address &#8220;RM2614, Wang Yung House, Cheung Wang, Tsing Yi, NT, HONG KONG&#8221;.<br />
I also did a search for <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=store724.com">store724.com</a>, and instantly top of the list a bunch of websites are returned with people referring  to one of the sellers I purchased my mp4 player from &#8220;<font size="-1">ugoole&#8221;</font>.</p>
<p>I take a look at the <a href="http://www.procopy.com.au/ugoogle-mp4">Procopy Perth website</a> which appears to detail this very well, however it is .au based.</p>
<p>From there I also find a UK based website entitled &#8220;<a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/henrietta.t/mp4/index.htm">mp3 / mp4 players on ebay beware!</a>&#8221; reporting the same details.</p>
<p>From here I discover some useful details, including a guide on <a href="http://reviews.ebay.co.uk/MP4-Player-From-Hong-Kong-RIPOFF-How-To-Check-GB-Size_W0QQugidZ10000000002190692">how to check the size of your mp4 player</a> and details of how to restore your mp4 players size to the correct capacity, which is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you haven&#8217;t already done so, install the &#8220;MP3 Player Utilities 4.00&#8221; from your CD now, also sometimes known as &#8220;AMV Convert Tool 3.68&#8221;.</li>
<li>Backup any data/media on your mp4 player onto your computer.</li>
<li>Plug your device into your computer via USB.</li>
<li>Run the MP3 Player Disk Tool (&#8220;C:\Program Files\MP3 Player Utilities 4.00\RDiskUtility\RdiskUtility.exe&#8221;)</li>
<li>Once it has successfully loaded select the format type as low, and click on the &#8220;Partition and Encryption&#8221; tab at the top.</li>
<li>Drag the slider entitled &#8220;Setting encrypted disk capacity&#8221; to the far right (until the disk size has reached its full capacity), and press Start.</li>
<li>Once complete, return the slider back to the far left, at 0, and press Start. (this will re-format the device to its TRUE capacity).</li>
</ol>
<p>That is it, exit the program, and your device is set to function correctly. I also found a longer <a href="http://www.mympxplayer.org/how-to-removing-memory-hack-vp13762.html#13762">guide here</a>.<br />
Although it seems like i&#8217;ve accepted that I&#8217;ve been ripped off and solved the problem with the device, I did not stop there.</p>
<p>I contacted the sellers on ebay and threatened to leave negative feedback if they didn&#8217;t agree on a deal with me. They eventually refunded me £8 per device, and I have yet to leave them feedback.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s just about everything, I hope that you find this information is useful.</p>
<p>Also read the <a href="http://reviews.ebay.com/The-Official-Fake-4GB-MP4-Player-Scam-On-eBay-FAQ_W0QQugidZ10000000002547758">The Official Fake 4GB+ MP4 Player Scam On eBay FAQ</a> on ebay, and whatever you do if you DO have one of these items, DO NOT send it back, but DO demand a refund like I did, chances are at least you will get a partial refund.</p>
<p>Note: I have noticed since that <a href="http://feedback.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback&amp;userid=e-britain">e-britain</a> and <a href="http://feedback.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback&amp;userid=ugoole">ugoole</a> have changed their feedback to &#8220;private&#8221; probably because people were posting links in their feedback. You can still email <a href="mailto:ugoole@store724.com">ugoole</a> and <a href="mailto:mobile@store724.com">e-britain</a>.</p>
