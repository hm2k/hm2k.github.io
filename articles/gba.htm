<h3>Nintendo Game Boy Advance SP: Tribal Edition</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="gallery/gba.jpg" width="240" height="178"></p>
<p>My girlfriend bought me a game boy for Christmas as I simply could not decide 
  on anything else I would want. A few of the games I got were GTA: Advance, Scooby 
  Doo, The Incredibles, and Zelda the minish cap.</p>
<p>The best features about the GBA:SP are the battery life, which is simply incredible, 
  after about 10mins of charge it lasted most of xmas day, another great feature 
  is the back light, this is the first game boy to have such a feature. Not only 
  that but the GBA does have a fantastic big screen, your mobile phone looks pathetic 
  compared. Also I must point out that the sound quality is very good, and very 
  clear.</p>
<p>The one game I have been playing none stop since I received my GBA is Zelda: 
  The minish cap. I loved playing the old game boy Zelda that was Zelda: Links 
  awakening on my old game boy, but this is even better. I have got to a point 
  so many times when I think I simply cannot go on any further, and I will be 
  literally trying EVERYTHING to get further, and finally I find it.</p>

  (I have mirrored the one I used at certain points for hints <a href="?articles=zelda_minish_cap">here</a>)</p>
<p>However now I am at that point again, but this time I have 999 rupees, 999 
  shells, full life of hearts, all the weapons, etc, and I am at the highest point 
  of the map above the clouds in the sky.</p>
<p>The end boss on this level is really rock solid. Especially when you have to 
  pass about 30 monsters to get to it each time you die from it.</p>
<p>Anyway back to the game boy itself... I really like my game boy, however there 
  are a few things I think Nintendo missed out when designing this little gadget.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Inferred - The old ones used to have it, why doesn't this one? It would 
    seriously save on damn link cables.</li>
  <li>A catch - There is no catch when the lid is closed, so it can come open 
    on its own if its in your bag for example.</li>
  <li>A button lock - A great idea would be to have a catch where when lid is 
    closed, the buttons would lock, this feature would be fantastic as the trigger 
    buttons (L and R) can still be used even if the lid is closed</li>
  <li>Screen off - The screen should turn off when the lid is closed (although 
    there is a black light on/off button), this would save power.</li>
  <li>Head/ear phone jack socket - It seems that you cannot power the GBA SP while 
    you listen to the sound on your headphones, this is rather annoying, I am 
    sure they could have easily implemented this.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope Nintendo read this and realise some of the features they are missing. 
  It really strikes me as odd that even the new GBA that has yet to be released 
  in the UK does not have some of these features either, even though it is excessively 
  advanced in terms of technology with its 2x screens one being touch screen. 
  It seems like Nintendo have simply missed the basics.</p>
