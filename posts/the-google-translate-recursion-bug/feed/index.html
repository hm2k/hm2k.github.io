					<description><![CDATA[I have been using Google Translator (Japanese to English) for many years in order to shop and bid on Yahoo Japan Auctions for Japanese Baseball Cards. I use to be able to do searches (just like using eBay), have the web page translated, and click on an item to have it&#039;s page/URL open in a new tab or on the same page in translated English. But for awhile now--month(s)--when I go to open a new link, a new auction, the Google Translator either doesn&#039;t translate it into English, or, more often it will go back to the main Yahoo Japan Auction home page in the original Japanese. This happens on all Yahoo Japan Auction pages as follows:

Go to the Google Translator page: http://www.google.com/language_tools?hl=en

Enter this or any Yahoo Japan Japanese Baseball card auction&#039;s URL into the Translate Web Page section (chose to translate from Japanese to English), such as this auction that ends in about 5 days: http://page18.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/auction/w65963357

And instead of translating the page it will either go to a Yahoo Japan Auction error page or more likely it will go back to the main/home page for Yahoo Japan Auctions. The Google Translator doesn&#039;t work, it no longer translates Yahoo Japan Auction item&#039;s web pages from Japanese into English.

I have the links to searches I do every night on Yahoo Japan Auctions using the Goggle Language translator, and these main search links will come in properly translated from Japanese into English, such as this  one on one of the main searches I do for Japanese baseball card auctions: 

http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcategory.auctions.yahoo.co.jp%2Flist%2F???????-??-????-??????????-??????-??????%2F21014%2F%3Fn%3D100%26p%3D???%26tab_ex%3Dcommerce%26auccat%3D21014%26slider%3D0&#038;sl=ja&#038;tl=en&#038;hl=&#038;ie=UTF-8

But once the translated search page comes in and you click on any of the auctions, they open but they are no longer translated into English. They use to automatically open translated into English. I also use to be able to click on any of the auctions to have them open in a new tab (Safari Browser) and they would be translated into English. But that no longer happens. The Google translator no longer works automatically for links, when I go to the item&#039;s auction page. 

And if you copy the un-translated URL for the auction, then go back to the translated search page, and paste the URL into the Google Translate section at the  top of the page, click translate, it doesn&#039;t work, it doesn&#039;t translate the page.  Instead, it either takes me to a Yahoo Japan Auction error page, or it takes me back to the Yahoo Japan Auction main home page. 

Long story short, Google&#039;s language translator for Japanese to English no longer works on Yahoo Japan Auctions, no longer works on the auction item&#039;s page using the translate the URL section of their translator.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, same thing happened to me when I tried it. There&#039;s been somewhat of another bug on Gmail too. When loading Gmail on a 0 or 1 bar connection level, it just refreshes automatically. I&#039;m not sure if my connection is the problem, or it could just be another one of Google&#039;s bugs.]]></description>
