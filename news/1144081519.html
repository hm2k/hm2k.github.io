<font style="color:#666; font-size:14;">Earn money by playing games!<br /><br />Yes thats right, you heard it here first! This is the next big thing...<br /><br />There's no signup fee or anything like that, only problem is, its currently invite only as its beta.<br /><br />I've got to level 6 so far, which was cool, i'm getting quite good at it now, but there's 30 levels in total, and there's only one game at the moment entitled "Gold Rush".<br /><br />How it works...<br />Once you have signed up you can start to play. You can play people at either the same level as you or levels below, the higher the level the more risk there is, the lower the levels the less there is to win.<br /><br />So you enter a game, you then watch an advertisement and answer a question on the advert (these get tiresum and samey after a while), this is how they make their money on this, via sponsorship deals, from people such as Nokia.<br /><br />The website then attempts to find a player for you, once they are found you can accept or deny them (this is useful if you have played them before), there is an intro, but once you're in the game you can see the user your playing against, their avatar, and when they joined.<br /><br />The game starts, you have 5 peices of gold their value is between 1 and 6, then there is what is best described as a sea-saw in where a peice of gold is placed by the computer, which is randomly worth between 1 and 6 again. The aim of the game is to out weigh the opponent.<br /><br />Most of the time this is down to chance, but after an hours worth of play, you start to get the hang of it and can predict what your opponent is likely to do. After you have used up your 6 peices of gold the game is over, whoever has the most gold is the winner.<br /><br />It is a little difficult to explain yes, however once you give it a go you'll figure it out.<br /><br /><img style="border: none;" alt="Moola" src="http://www.hm2k.org/news/data/upimages/moola_small.jpg" /> <br /><br />Visit <a href="http://www.moola.com/">moola.com</a><br /><br />Note: Payout is only to US/CA at the moment. Oh and I don't have many invites at the moment, so unless I know you well, don't ask!</font></td>
