					<description><![CDATA[What I resent about this Genuine Advantage business is the inference that your MS Operating System may not be &quot;legal&quot;. I bought my XP Pro several years ago. I do not wish to have to further satisfy the seller (MS) that it is a genuine purchase. I do not have to do this with any other  purchases I make - cars, clothing and so on. How would it be regarded if the car dealer asked you to prove you were the legitimate owner of the car you bought.

I have not succumbed to MS&#039;s invitation to install WGA. What I would appreciate is a method to prevent the bloody WGA window appearing each time I boot up.

Can anyone help?]]></description>
