					<description><![CDATA[OLLIE, I have written and recorded my own songs that I have up on my Myspace profile from about 5 years ago.  Since losing my hard drive, and a few cd&#039;s I have no other copies of this music.  Is it immoral for me to download my own songs this way?  This information is NOT just for pirates...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[if everyone stole music, then we&#039;ll be left with REAL artists with REAL passion for music and does not do it for the $$$

If you want cash, try being a corporate whore instead of being a musician. If you want bread on your table, get a real job. If you want to spread your music, then share it with people.

If nobody wants to waste $$$ on your music, it probably SUCKS anyway. Time to quit ese!!! 

I&#039;d rather burn my hard earned $$$ than waste it on wannabe posers who wishes the rockstar lifestyle but can easily cause ear cancer, if there&#039;s such a thing.

I really hope this file sharing phenomenon becomes more accepted, so shitty bands become obsolete and the true artists get their due. Then it&#039;s time for me to part with my money and actually support those that spread real love.

And stop comparing music to some stupid concrete commodity.  Try getting yourself some education first, and stop wasting your time on facebook, dumb twats.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[if everyone stole music, bands would NOT stop existing.... TLC had the number 1 hit on the charts, and they were filing for bankruptcy... you dont make money from cds, you make money from shows, and from merchandise.  you cant STEAL a shirt off the internet.. CDs actually get music out to the people, they get to know the songs better, and there is ALWAYS a greater chance people will come out and pay to see you if they actually have heard your songs before, and are familiar with them.... so in retrospect, stealing music would HELP most struggling bands.... I was in a band that toured around, and i can vouch for this 100%]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll pay to download when FLAC is an option. 

I download mp3s because it&#039;s free.  Paying for mp3s is a waste of my money.

READ LINE ONE of this post until it sinks in... then do it... THEN WATCH SALES INCREASE]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s estimate that for each song that itunes sells, they earn 30% profit from it. The rest is passed onto the record label who then divide it up, and likely give the artist about 10%, depending on the contract and royalties.

So, you see, in the end, that 90p track, is probably worth less than 10p to the artist, thus, it&#039;s better to pay them directly in other ways.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[you complete twit !! 
of course they make more money from tours and ticket sales 
but what you are doing is still wrong !!

so if a band just starts up and HAS there single on itunes and on myspace  you think its okay  to just some how nick it from myspace and not pay the 90p or so to just buy it  from itunes ??????

thats the question !!!

for the sake of paying the band 90p back  from the money they spent on recording there songs !! 

your a cheap skate]]></description>
