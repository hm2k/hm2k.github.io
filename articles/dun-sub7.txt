--------------------------------------------
Note: this document is very old...

http://subseven.slak.org

Default Port: 27374 (or 1243)

Scan for [BT Internet(*@*.btinternet.com)]: 213.1.1.1 - 213.1.225.225
Scan for [OneTel (*@*.onetel.net.uk)]: 212.67.100.1 - 212.67.255.1

OK now you have the information download Sub7 then click 
connection then ip scanner use the IP for one of the companies
and search. once you get an IP paste it at the top where it says
ip/uin: and then press connect (and yes leave the Delay on 4).
Once connected (sometimes they won't)
click advanced then passwords and choose retrieve RAS passwords
and there you go you will have one of these accounts.
I would apreciate it if you sent us what you find because accounts need updating
all the time as they get closed down due to over use by people like you. :P
