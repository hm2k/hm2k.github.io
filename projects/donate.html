<h1>Donate to HM2K </h1>
<p>My theory is that if you ask people nice enough they will donate a bit of their money to a cause.</p>
<p>My aim is to reach &pound;3500 which would pay off certain debts, anything OVER &pound;3500, will go directly to a charity of my choice, but don't let this be a reason to donate money, no no. </p>
<p>There are a few things I would be willing to do in return for your cash: </p>
<ul>
  <li>I would  be willing to offer a bit of publicity in the form of a link to your website if you donate.</li>
  <li>I would  be willing to help with any code or scripts you think I could help you with.</li>
  <li>I would be willing to host a file for you on my web server.</li>
  <li>I would be willing to help you fix a problem with your windows computer.</li>
  <li>I would be willing to help you with your freebsd shell servers or linux web servers (or variations).</li>
  <li>I would be willing to help you wish various IRC issues. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Its not really a tall order, if 350 people offered up as little as &pound;10, the target would be reached very quickly.</em></p>
<p>I will be listing who pays and how much, whether its &pound;1 or &pound;100, you will be listed.</p>
<p>So if you like any of my projects or files that I provide, or infact you just like me (or maybe you don't), feel free to donate your cash.</p>
