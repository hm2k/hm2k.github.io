										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a Blackberry Pearl 8900 on O2, I&#8217;ve had it a while now.</p>
<p>One big gripe I had with it is that the ringer doesn&#8217;t last long enough.</p>
<p>By the time I&#8217;ve pulled it out of my pocket, taken it out of it&#8217;s pocket, and assessed whether I want to answer the call, it&#8217;s already too late, especially if I&#8217;m in the middle of doing something else.</p>
<p>So, I can&#8217;t expect it to be perfect, but surely the ring time can be extended or increased? Here&#8217;s the solution&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-488"></span>Enter **61*901*11*xx# in to the phone, where xx is, enter the amount of time you want it to ring before it goes to voicemail.</p>
<p>For example: **61*901*11*30# would mean it would ring for 30 seconds before going on to voicemail.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve no idea what the default was, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s too low.</p>
<p><em>Next: </em>Use a ringtone that doesn&#8217;t have a silent lead.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago I noticed that the alerts for text messages has mysteriously gone missing and completely stopped working.</p>
<p><span id="more-191"></span></p>
<p>The alert tone no longer sounded, the alert vibration no longer occurred, and worst of all there was no popup alert that says there&#8217;s a new text message.</p>
<p>However, if I went into the &#8220;Messages&#8221; area, my Inbox would clearly have a red &#8220;plus&#8221; symbol to indicate there is a new message, which I could go into it and read it as normal.</p>
<p>This is most annoying!</p>
<p><strong>What I tried:</strong></p>
<p>When the problem first occurred, my initial thought was to check the ringer, to ensure that wasn&#8217;t the problem. As it turns out, it wasn&#8217;t, and it was clearly far beyond that.</p>
<p>I backed up my data to my memory card, and re-flashed the phone to the latest possible update available to me which was v12.0.013, which was in fact the flash version I was already running.</p>
<p>I sent a test message to the phone, with all the default settings after the flash. It worked!</p>
<p>I restored my data from my memory card, but then it did not work&#8230;</p>
<p>There was a fix out there, there had to be. The phone was running a bit slow, so I figured it was down to the 2000+ text messages I had stored on there. I deleted them all. No fix.</p>
<p><strong>What fixed it:</strong></p>
<p>As it turns out, to fix this problem, that seems to occur when you have over 2000 text messages in your inbox, you need to first delete all the messages (by using the &#8220;mark all&#8221; option, then delete), and forcing a hard reset by removing the battery while the phone is switched on (and idle).</p>
<p>You MUST do both of these, else it doesn&#8217;t appear to fix the problem.</p>
<p>I hope that this problem is fixed in v20, and that T-Mobile UK will role it out soon!</p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://discussions.nokia.ie/discussions/board/message?board.id=smartphones&amp;message.id=77515#M77515">this post</a> for the solution.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I HATE this phone, here&#8217;s why&#8230;<span id="more-119"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>It allows you to go into &#8220;create a message&#8221; even when the memory is full and there&#8217;s no possible way to send it. So you spend the time to write a text message, and you can&#8217;t send it anyway!</li>
<li>When the battery is low, it lets off a loud shrill of a noise CONSTANTLY. It&#8217;s VERY annoying, VERY loud, and so unnecessary. There seems to be no way to turn it off either. The only times I seem to get this is either when I&#8217;m trying to sleep or when I&#8217;m with a client, neither times do I have a method to charge the phone.</li>
<li>The camera is of very poor quality. Enough said.</li>
<li>The &#8220;Flip&#8221; mechanism is flimsy and is practically broken.</li>
<li>After a year the phone is starting to show signs of wear, the silver paint is coming off, showing a black under layer, the cover that covers the camera on the outside cracked, and consequently fell off.</li>
<li>Trying to add a new word into the dictionary is near impossible. The damn thing is so difficult to use.</li>
<li>When you get a message or a missed call, the phone will beep/vibrate every few minutes to remind you. This gets very annoying. On other phones there are more subtle methods such as an LED on the outside that remains lit when attention is needed.</li>
<li>The HUGE blue fading light that has absolutely NO purpose other than to annoy me while I sleep at night, while it charges. WHY couldn&#8217;t this be used for alerts and such?</li>
<li>To inset the memory card, you must take off the battery cover&#8230; WHY didn&#8217;t they just make a slot?</li>
<li>This phone is unnecessary bulky and ugly.</li>
<li>There is no signal to let you know that the call has ended, so you can continue to speak even though the call has ended. How difficult would it be to add a subtle beep at the end of the call?</li>
<li>When the LEDs on the number pad are lit they make a very loud humming noise which is most distracting.</li>
<li>This phone appears to get interference with EVERYTHING. If it has a speaker, chances are when you&#8217;re making a call you get a constant buzz. Even phones from the 90s didn&#8217;t do this as bad.</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t set bluetooth to discovery mode for more than 3 minutes. This is annoying.</li>
<li>This phone crashes often.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/v3x.jpg" title="Motorola V3X"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/v3x.jpg" title="Motorola V3X"><img src="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/v3x.jpg" alt="Motorola V3X" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/v3x.jpg" title="Motorola V3X"></a>Good things&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>I can sync it with Outlook!</li>
<li>It plays MP3s, and plays them as ringtones too!</li>
<li>It takes photos.</li>
<li>It can do videos, just not very well.</li>
<li>You can do video calling.</li>
<li>It can charge via USB.</li>
<li>The screen is quite a good size, and pretty clear.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I hate this phone, but I did get it for free.</p>
<p>Anyway onto my next phone&#8230; the Nokia N95.</p>

<p>It costs £20 to get your phone unlocked by Orange and the only way to do this is to contact them by phone, and the only way to contact Orange&#8217;s Customer Services is to call 150 from your handset or call 07973 100150. What if you&#8217;re deaf? What if your handset is broken? What if you cannot call mobile numbers from your landline?</p>
<p>This is why Orange sucks. Naturally, I didn&#8217;t pay orange a penny.</p>
<p><span id="more-112"></span>These are the steps to unlock the Samsung E720 phone:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="postbody">Put in the sim you want to use, turn it on.</span></li>
<li><span class="postbody">Enter </span>&#8220;00000000&#8221; (8 zeros) <span class="postbody">as the sim code if it asks, it should now say &#8220;wrong sim&#8221;.</span></li>
<li>Type *#9998*3323# in to your phone</li>
<li>Press the top right button and hit Exit, the phone will reboot</li>
<li>After you do this, you should be able to get onto the menu from there go to the settings menu and select security, go to SIM lock and it should be enabled, select disable and enter the code &#8220;00000000&#8221; (8 zeros).</li>
<li>Switch off the phone</li>
<li>Switch on the phone still with the sim you want to use in.</li>
<li>Enter your pin code if requested, then enter the sim code as &#8220;00000000&#8221; (8 zeros).</li>
<li>It should say &#8220;wrong sim&#8221; again.</li>
<li>Type *#9998*3323# in to your phone again.</li>
<li>Select option 1 (Task loop), the phone will reboot.</li>
<li>Type *#9998*3323# in to your phone again.</li>
<li>Select option 7 (“Jump to Null”), the phone will reboot.<span class="postbody"></span></li>
<li><span class="postbody">Type in *0141# (This sets the phone to the network on the sim thats in)</span></li>
<li><span class="postbody">Power off, and power on, it should work fine.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Done!</p>
<p>Note: You may need to do a &#8220;system restart&#8221; from the menu too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I bought this on the 20/08/04 for £179.99, which actually seems quite a lot for such a phone, but it was not bad at the time for a brand new unlocked phone.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/cx65.jpg" title="Siemens CX65 Mobile Phone"><img src="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/cx65.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Siemens CX65 Mobile Phone" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/cx65.jpg" title="Siemens CX65"></a></p>
<p>I decided to get this phone as I had a Siemens ME45 before and that was great for it&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this phone had a very stylish design. It was one of few non-flip phones on the market as they appeared to be becoming the norm. I have always been under the impression that like small convertibles, they are girlie.</p>
<p>The features I particularly liked when I purchased this phone were the custom polyphonic ring tones, vibrate, IRDA, build-in camera for photos and video, navigation joystick, integrated antenna, loudspeaker, &#8220;dynamic lights&#8221; for alerts, full colour display, video playback, silent mode and the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook.</p>
<p>At the time of it&#8217;s release cameras were begining to become established in phones and were now the standard, as such this phone even came with an optional flash which plugged into the bottom. Quality of photos and video is reasonable.</p>
<p>Obviously it also came with standard features such as SMS, MMS and Internet/WAP, oh and of course the ability to make  and receive calls.</p>
<p>As you can tell, this phone is pretty feature-tastic, the only thing it is missing from it&#8217;s elegant design is bluetooth. To begin with this didn&#8217;t matter as no one had bluetooth either, but as more and more phones came with bluetooth as standard, this phone got left behind.</p>
<p>Regardless, this is a fantastic phone. One of the best things is the navigation. Finding anything was easy, and once you were in it, it was easy to use. Text messages supported T9, which was really simple to work with, compared to other phones.</p>
<p>I also loved the management options such as copy and paste, and the phone number highlighting so you can dial a number you are sent with ease.</p>
<p>One of my favorite features was the dynamic lights. These are used when you receive a missed call or a text message to continually alert you that you have to attend to it, without continuously releasing a distressing noise like other phones, otherwise known as silent alerts. You are able to turn off the dynamic lights feature.</p>
<p>This phone also comes with some useful applications such as calculator (which is difficult to use), calendar, notes, task, dictating, stop watch, count down, unit converter, alarm clock, media player and all sorts of other software functions I would probably never get around to using, but at least I know they are there.</p>
<p>Another great feature of this phone was its ability to run java. This meant you could easily get hold of, and install new applications and new games to extend the possibilities of this phone.</p>
<p>Although this phone has quite a bit of storage space, for some strange reason, it could only seem to manage 100 text messages on the phone, and the standard 10 on the sim card. I never worked that out.</p>
<p>One thing I did find useful, was the ability to sync with outlook. Although to begin with the software that came with the phone wasn&#8217;t very good, Siemens released new software which was far better. Also the data connection was serial not USB, this meant your power was drained very quickly.</p>
<p>The benefit of this though was that I was able to use <a href="http://www.hendrik-sattler.de/scmxx/">SCMxx</a>, which is command line based communication software which I used for sending text messages from my computer without having to type with my thumb on my phone or use bulky software.</p>
<p>However, I think this is going to be the last Siemens I buy, and is almost definately the last of its kind, as on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4616515.stm">07/06/05 Siemens AG (Siemens Mobile) announced it was being bought by BenQ (formerly Acer)</a>, but it all spells trouble for me, and as far as I can see it is a struggling company, and is having difficulty competing in today&#8217;s market. It is only a matter of time before its is bankrupt.</p>
<p>Conclusion: This was a great phone and simply lacked bluetooth, it&#8217;s time to move on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a very early age I have been taught to write the English language correctly, I try and carry this trend over when I&#8217;m on the internet.</p>
<p>However, over the years a new language has developed based on English, which I&#8217;m sure everyone is familiar with these days, it&#8217;s commonly known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_language">SMS language</a>.</p>
<p>It appears that it originally came from bulletin boards and chatrooms particularly the ones that are popular on the AOL network and is, therefore, sometimes called AOL speak.</p>
<p>The main reason why this language came about over the years is that kids began sending text messages to each other via their mobile phones, however the problem lies when they wish to send a message longer than 160 characters, this would span over two or more messages, meaning more costs. As you can probably imagine, kids soon got the idea that you could type a message quicker by using this language and keep costs down by keeping your message within the 160 character limit.</p>
<p>Although this is probably information you already know, recently, questions of whether using this type of language should be acceptable or not have come up.</p>
<p>To begin with I agreed with the majority of people who said English is English, we should use it correctly. However I began to think about where English actually came from, and how evolution has turned English into the language it is today.</p>
<p>I do agree that when people write articles, reports and such it would be probably be best if true English was used, however who are we to say that this new language is not acceptable in today&#8217;s modern world, after all it is us who created the need for it, and it is us who encouraged it.</p>
<p>I think over the next few years we will be forced to accept and embrace this new language as part of every day life, as an extension of the English language,  that is of course, unless it has already happened.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get asked quite often if I know how to get a mobile phone unlocked, so this is my experience&#8230;</p>
<p>I was given a Motorola V525 as the original owner had an upgrade. They are on the vodafone network, and I am on O2.</p>
<p>When I put an O2 simcard in the phone it asked me to &#8220;Enter Subsidy Password&#8221; (other phones may say &#8220;Enter Special Code&#8221;), I tried a few random numbers (probably about 15 by the time I had finished), and the phone locked up. Displaying the following: &#8220;Contact Service Provider&#8221;, and it will not go away.</p>
<p>However, there is a solution I found at: <a href="http://www.gsm-unlock.com/unlock/unlock-motorola.html">http://www.gsm-unlock.com/unlock/unlock-motorola.html</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Q: I keep getting the following prompt on my Motorola after I insert another sim card &#8220;Contact Service Provider&#8221; ?<br />
A: That means wrong unlock code has been entered already!<br />
(This message appears after many wrong subsidy or special code entry)<br />
Power on phone and wait between 30 min to 8 hours till Enter Subsidy or Special Code<br />
message appear again! (Please note that phone should be powered on during this time).</p></blockquote>
<p>I left it turned on, and charging over night, and came to it the following day, it asked me for the unlock code.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="http://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/1/283892">this forum</a> I discovered that you CANNOT unlock the Razr V3, or V525 or any other Motorola simply by providing someone with your IMEI code.</p>
<p>As far as I can see there are only THREE ways around this:<br />
1. You need a datacable (~$10) and <a href="http://www.motophoenix.com/moto_unlock.htm">MotoPhoenix</a> ($25) &#8212; It seems <a href="http://www.mark-world.tv/motorola/manual.pdf">this guy here</a> has achieved it using a datacable and some choice software&#8230;<br />
2. Contact your phone carrier/operator or service provide (O2, Orange, Vodafone, T-Mobile, etc) and ask them for the unlock code, like <a href="http://www.radwin.org/michael/blog/2004/04/tmobile_sim_unlock_part_1.html">this guy did</a>.</p>
<p>They will ask you for the following details:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mobile Telephone Number:<br />
Customer Account Number:<br />
Full Name:<br />
Full Address:<br />
Date of Birth:</p>
<p>Make:<br />
Model:<br />
IMEI:</p></blockquote>
<p>3. The third way involves using buy methods, such as buying from ebay, gsm-unlock.com or fonefunshop.co.uk, but as these methods are completly untested (by me), and they don&#8217;t tell you how it works, I wouldn&#8217;t advise them.</p>
<p>I used method 2, and after a few emails back and forth, and a phone call from the previous owner, I was provided with 2 unlock codes and told that one of them would work.</p>
<p>I have since then used the same method again with Vodafone (ccare.webmails@vf.vodafone.co.uk) for a Motorola V3X, this time I simply put a request for the unlock code, and provided them with the details (as above), within 3 hours I had a reply from them, as follows:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><span style="color: red"><span style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 50%; font-size: 9pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"> <span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial">NETWORK  UNLOCK CODE</span></font></span></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Thank you for your  email to Vodafone about the network unlock code (NUC) you requested. I&#8217;ll be  happy to assist. Your NUC is as follows:</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td>XXXXXXXX</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="2">I hope this information is of  use. Please contact me if you require any further assistance.</font></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Best  wishes,</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial">Neil Breeze </span><br />
Vodafone  Customer Services</font></span></p>
<p>This worked no problems, so I sent an email back to them congratulating them on their quick response, which makes a change.</p>
