Apart from that, I smply followed your steps.

Thanks alot,

					<description><![CDATA[The script works great. For non scripters.. the character errors are caused by double quotes getting copied as some other wierd character.. Replace those with the normal double quote and the script works great. Thanks a Lot

					<description><![CDATA[This works great!  

I use ffmpeg to convert video for my phone, and I use shortcuts in  SendTo for Notepad, but never thought about putting a vbs script in there.

Thanks very much for this tip!  Now I can listen to wma files on my phone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With regards to the quotes, yes, unfortunately wordpress encodes them stupidly, and i&#039;ve not yet got around to figuring out how to disable that. You just need to manually put real quotes in.

As for the rest, you must be doing something wrong.

Use WScript.Echo objExec to return the string, then type that into a cmd, see if it works from there.

It should display an error, and you can take it from there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It runs the script, but nothing happens? what&#039;s wrong? it&#039;s supposed to convert the existing wma into an mp3 right there in the folder right? any of the test wma&#039;s I&#039;ve used the script on, opens the &quot;lame&quot; looking dialog box for a split second, then says done, but nothing changes to the file, or if it does it doesn&#039;t tell me where the new one is located?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[well I got it to run the script. the issue is that when you copy from &quot;firefox&quot; the quotation marks become smart quotes and the script can&#039;t read them. I finally figured out that you had to open that up in wordpad change the quotes by retyping them, also the longest line of code needs to all be on one line, and it needs to be saved in &quot;unicode text&quot;]]></description>
