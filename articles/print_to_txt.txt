How to Print to a Text File
---------------------------
Device Manager does not have a Save command available for you to save a report to a text file. To save a Device Manager report to a text file, you must install a generic, text-only printer, and then redirect the Device Manager report to this printer.

To print to a text file:
1.	Click Start, and then click Printers and Faxes.
2.	Click Add a Printer, and then choose the following options in the wizard:
a. 	Click Local Printer.
b. 	Click to clear the Automatically detect and install my Plug and Play printer check box.
c. 	Click Use the Following Port, and then click FILE (Print to file).
d. 	Click Generic in the Manufacturer box.
e. 	Click Generic / Text Only in the Printers box.
f. 	Name the printer.
g. 	Click Do not share this printer.
h. 	Click No when you are prompted to print a test page.
3.	When you click the printer in the Print dialog box, Windows prompts you for a file name.
