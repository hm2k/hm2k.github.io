					<description><![CDATA[If you have a large movie clip and it either is corrupt (ie. no index from a partial download) or it uses an unsupported codec, then Explorer tries to load the whole file. This can slow your computer a lot and prevent deleting/renaming/moving/etc the file until it’s finished.
Simply do the following steps:
1) Open a command window (Start-&#062;Run, type in &#039;cmd&#039; hit enter)
2) To remove image preview, type and hit enter
regsvr32 /u shimgvw.dll
3) To readd image preview, type and hit enter
regsvr32 shimgvw.dll
4) To remove media preview, type and hit enter
regsvr32 /u shmedia.dll  (RECOMMENDED) 
5) To readd media preview, type and hit enter
regsvr32 shmedia.dll

					<description><![CDATA[hey guys
had same problem
tried few things [disable avi handler, through &quot;ShellExView&quot; - didnt help, unistalled divx- didnt help
downloaded klite- didnt install yet- but solved my problem by tryin sth i noticed: on ShellExView i searched for items that has to do with AVI etc... and i found this: Video Thumbnail Extractor - i disabled it, and IT WORKS!!!!! u guys should try it too, before installing\uninstallin other stuf :)
i think it&#039;ll work for u too!
NOTE: if i try playin these crashin files through double-click media player- i get the crash!!!
so, i just use VLC to watch the files and thats it!!!
worked like charm, worth a try, and raelly easy- if it works for u too- spread the word like ppl already said, thanks for the help and team cooporation guys :D enjoy watchin them movies :D]]></description>
