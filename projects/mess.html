<h1>MSN Messenger for mIRC </h1>
<p>The original idea was to create something that would allow a single msn messenger (support staff of a a shell/web hosting company) to be used by more than one user.</p>
<p>My solution to this was to use a peice of software that was already in use by the people who requested it, mIRC.</p>
<p>The script I created allows  users to reply to incoming messages that are relayed from msn messenger to a (private) channel of your choice. It would also allow the user on the local client to use  line based commands (such as /msnmsg) to use the functions, making it very simple to utilise.</p>
<p>I was also planning on creating a TCL version of this script for eggdrops, but that has yet to be seen.</p>
<p><em>If you would like to use this script for your company, or perhaps you would like to see this script go public (or perhaps not), please feel free to make a considerable <a href="donate">donation</a> (&pound;20 or more), and we will come to an understanding.</em></p>
