					<description><![CDATA[The sooner you get the OEM Norton or McAfee off a new PC the better. These guys rely on their strong OEM foothold instead of making sure their products are tip top.
For consumers, there are only really three to choose from - Nod32, Kaspersky and BitDefender.

Free antivirus is OK, but what it costs for support when things go wrong far outweighs the price you&#039;d pay for a commercial licence. http://www.antivirusmarket.co.uk are selling bitDefender antivirus for about 12 quid at the moment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been using Avast for 4 years now.  I used to have AVG but I got 3 backdoor trojan viruses in the time that I used it, so a colleague at Computacenter recommended Avast.  Arrr, Avast ye indeed.  In the 4 years I have been using it I have not had a virus infect my system, so I have not had the need to remove any viruses.  One thing about Avast however is that when I try to run a full system scan it never seems to get past 48% these days.  Maybe my system is a little on the large size with 4 hard drives but it does stop anything getting onto the PC in the first place so I would recommend Avast Home edition to anyone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am using at home the AVG Free Edition - last time I checked it was among the few antiviruses which were both free and officialy compatible with Vista..
About “tweaking” it’s nothing special: I think most if not all antiviruses have some option to disable the file scanning engine and to leave only other components enabled (email scanner, etc.)]]></description>
