<h1>SEO Tips</h1>
<ul>
  <li>You must get indexed by the search engines, most offer a method to submit your site, however its FAR better to simply get a linkback from another website. Let them find you naturally. </li>
  <li>Keep the text between the title tags under 50 chrs - This will help you get the most out of your keywords </li>
  <li>Avoid using dynamic URLs (eg: http://www.example.com/index.php?id=123) use static looking links instead (eg: http://www.example.com/example-articles.html) -- Also avoid PHP session IDs and unnessisary variables. </li>
  <li>Register your domains for longer than a year - spammers usually only buy domains for 1 or 2 years.</li>
  <li>Larger, older sites are better. </li>
  <li>In search engines &quot;the-word&quot; usually registers as &quot;the word&quot;, so where possible use - (dash) instead of _ (underscore) in your URLs </li>
  <li>Choose a domain that will be most relivant to you, either your name (product, company, business, etc) or descriptive (eg: search-engine-optimisation-example.com)</li>
  <li>Dashes in URL (eg: http://www.search-engine-optimisation-example.com/the-home-page.html) -- stick to no more than 4 in a URL.</li>
  <li>Keep your URLs short, less than 100 chrs is best.</li>
  <li>Unique description meta tags per page - less than 200 chrs, although search engines don't rely on this, it is often displayed</li>
  <li> Unique keyword meta tags per page - less than 10 words, the keywords must appear on the body text of the page, no repeats</li>
  <li>Make use of the header tags (H1, H2, H3) these will help idenify what the page is and push your page further to the top</li>
  <li>Place your keywords in your body text near the top, try and use b (bold), strong (bold) or em (italics) on them.</li>
  <li>By internet standards all images must have alt text - Describe the image using short relivant text. </li>
  <li>Use keywords for your link anchor text instead of using &quot;click here&quot; or such. </li>
  <li>External links per page should be a limited to 100 where possible.</li>
  <li>Choose your domain name TLD extention carefully, .edu and .org appear to get higher status than .com due to spam.</li>
  <li>Size of pages should not be larger than 100K, its prefered that you have lots of smaller pages.</li>
  <li> Search engines like updated pages, such as news pages, it also like additional pages, make sure you also keep your old static pages.</li>
  <li>Site consistancy -- althought its not proven to be a factor of SEO, it does help usability. </li>
  <li>Search engines like blog sites as they bare lots of content and many external links, showing trends</li>
  <li>Use text instead of images where possible. If you have to use images, use alt text. - Search engines don't read text on images. </li>
  <li>Get listed in directories such as DMOZ and Yahoo, avoid link farms and FFAs.</li>
  <li> Avoid using meta redirect to redirect users to other pages.</li>
  <li>Avoid excessive cross-linking to sites hosted on the same IP range (C class).</li>
  <li>DO NOT copy your content. Not only does this violate copyright laws, search engines penalise you. </li>
  <li> Search engines find it difficult to get relivant text from Flash if any at all, avoid contructing your page with flash, unless its for  presentational purposes.</li>
  <li>Search engines don't follow links in forms, image mapping, javascript links, frames, very well, if not, not at all. </li>
  <li>Avoid putting your email address in text form on a page, as this will appear in search engines and generate unwanted emails</li>
  <li>Avoid any &quot;black hat&quot; SEO methods, they don't work in the long run, stick at the real methods and you'll get far better results than risk your site getting banned.</li>
  <li>Use correct HTML markup where possible, although this doesn't make much of a difference to the search engines, it will help you avoid other problems.</li>
  <li>Don't use gateway pages or intro pages, they are useless and tend to disappear from search engines, not only that but the main page gets pushed down. -- This is also bad for usability as visitors aren't interested in your gateway, just your website.</li>
  <li>Try and get as many backlinks from as many relivant websites as possible. Avoid bad sites. -- Anchor text on your links is important here, make sure you use a relivant keyword.</li>
  <li> Try and get people to stay on your site, avoid annoying the user and provide them with reasons to stick around.</li>
  <li>Suggest the user bookmarks your page or create pages that would be bookmark worthy.</li>
  <li>Use a stable web server, there is nothing worse than having your site down.</li>
