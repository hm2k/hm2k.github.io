					<description><![CDATA[Reading this article made me laugh..

Everybody assumes all kids in today&#039;s world type in text talk. Well i am 16 - Not extremely bright (as my spelling may show) but i hate typeing the sms language - I know more adults then children that use sms language - It&#039;s just how people adapt to things..

And weather or not everyone will accept the new language - They&#039;ll have no choice really, saying the don&#039;t accept it will not make it dissapear. Everyo should just bite their tongues and hope the language dies down.

This new language was created the same way everything else was created. We should just be thankful there is help on the internet to translate it all haha.

Thanks x]]></description>
