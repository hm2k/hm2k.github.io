										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently had an issue with a US based company who asked us for the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Copy of your business license via PDF/JPG scanned (preferred) and emailed or faxed</p></blockquote>
<p>We went on to explain that we don&#8217;t have a business license, they clearly didn&#8217;t understand and they proclaimed:<span id="more-655"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Most cities and many counties do require businesses &#8212; even tiny home-based sole proprietorship &#8212; to register with them and pay at least a minimum tax. In return, your business will receive a business license or tax registration certificate. Even if they do not require you to have one in the UK, we do. We must have something on files stating something along the lines that you are allowed to conduct business in your country.</p></blockquote>
<p>I explained that in the UK there is no such thing as a business license, that is why there is no requirement.</p>
<p>I also stated that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are registered with HMRC to pay our tax, but they do not  provide a license, certificate or otherwise. Just a tax return form,  which you fill out and return every year.</li>
<li>We do not have a &#8220;Certificate of Incorporation&#8221; as a business is not a corporation.</li>
<li>We do not have a &#8220;local business office&#8221;, we have a Chambers of  Commerce, who, if contacted, will say same thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>To which they replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>To clarify, you are telling me there is absolutely nothing you can show us to prove that you are a registered business or allowed to conduct business in the UK?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>There must be something from your government you can provide that will show us you are a business.</p></blockquote>
<p>I went on to explain that our government provides no method to register with them  as a business and that in the UK you become a business as soon as you  begin trading as a business. Of course, we are registered with the  government for tax, but they only provide the tax return form.</p>
<p>To which they replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank you for your reply. After reviewing your detailed information and further investigation we found the information you provided is correct, and you do not need a business license.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, that&#8217;s right folks: You don&#8217;t need a business license to run a business in the UK.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently an online radio station I listen to called PlusFM stopped displaying track titles on their stream. This was a pain for quickly displaying the current track you were listening to, however I did figure out a work around&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-567"></span>Here&#8217;s my setup&#8230;</p>
<p>I have two machines in my office, one has a hifi system attached, the other does not.</p>
<p>I use the lightweight media player <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar2000">Foobar2000</a> (foobar2000.org), developed by Peter Pawlowski, a former freelance contractor for Nullsoft. So you know it&#8217;s a good alternative to Winamp.</p>
<p>In Foobar2000 I add the location for PlusFM&#8217;s stream:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://91.121.48.90">http://91.121.48.90</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I then use the last.fm plugin for audio scrobbling in Foobar2000 (<a href="http://www.mp3tag.de/en/fb2k.html">foo_audioscrobbler.dll</a>).</p>
<p>This allows me to feed the track I&#8217;m listening to the last.fm API.</p>
<p>I can then call their API and display the current track I&#8217;m playing on any device, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>I currently use it in combination with my &#8220;last.fm&#8221; mIRC script, which calls the API, reads the currently playing track, then displays it on screen when you trigger it using the /amp command.</p>
<p>This mean that when I hear a song I like, I could display it to share it with others, or just display it for my own interest.</p>
<p>This was great, until recently, when plusFM changed, and decided to stop displaying the track names on their feed&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>* +HM2K is listening to www.plusfm.net &#8211; current track available on www.plusfm.net &lt;www.last.fm/user/hm2k&gt;</p></blockquote>
<p>I understand that you guys want more hits to your site, but you&#8217;re messing up my last.fm feed.</p>
<p>Perhaps PlusFM could sign up to last.fm and feed the audio scrobbler, then I can simply read it from there!</p>
<p>Or perhaps I could read it directly from your site&#8230;</p>
<p>So it turns out there&#8217;s a feed on the site I can read from instead&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.plusfm.net/titre_plusfm.php">http://www.plusfm.net/titre_plusfm.php</a></p></blockquote>
<p>So I wrote a little script for it called plusfm.mrc&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="http://hm2k.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/code/mirc/plusfm.mrc">plusfm.mrc</a></li>
<li>Usage: /plusfm</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>[12:16:48 pm] * HM2K now playing Justice &#8211; Genesis &lt;www.plusfm.net&gt;</p></blockquote>
