					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for this Epson stylus C46. Great Christmas gift :-)

Only one enhancement in the how-to; the following statements are (for C46) in the wrong order:

(The question whether the pads have been replaced pops up after protection resetting)

‚Ä¢If it asks if you replaced with the pads; say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù. Then close the window.
‚Ä¢You will see a SSC Service Utilitiy icon (it looks like a printer) in the system tray (next to your click), and LEFT click.
‚Ä¢A menu will appear, from here you can click on ‚ÄúProtection counter‚Äù (its a red cross), then ‚Äúreset protection counter‚Äù.]]></description>

@Clifford

Thanks for the information.

When I contact Epson in the past, they weren&#039;t very helpful.

The page you mention has only existed since 2008, this article was written in 2007.

You really should maintain your ink pads otherwise ink will overflow all over your desk.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why hasn&#039;t a single user on this site spoken to Epson about the problem at hand?  I spoke with a tech and said it would be a shame to add the printer to a landfill simply due to the ink pads needing replacement.  He sent me to a link on the Epson website which provided a utility to reset the counter with which worked like a charm.  The file is named EpsonIPRUtility_A10.exe and may be downloaded from their website from this link:

http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/InkPadsForm.jsp?cookies=no&#038;com.broadvision.session.new=Yes

I have not performed any maintenance on the ink pads and the printer is working just fine.  i have been using a CISS ink system for a few years with this printer and it has been a huge money saver.  The CISS ink system and replacement bottles of 400 ml ink of each color X 6 cost me $125.00 and will last several years saving the equivalent of about 20 sets of ink cartridges which would cost about $1,500.00!  The ink is every bit the equivalent to the Epson in color and all other aspects.  I actually feel that the Red reproduction is better then the Espon ink without even profiling the new ink to the paper being used.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks to this site, I was able to fix Epson Stylus C48 printer which was showing the error: ‚ÄúParts inside your printer are at the end of their service life. See your printer documentation.‚Äù 
I opened the printer and changed the pads. My wife had some similar material so I cut 4 pads to size and fit them in. 
I also downloaded the &quot;SSC Service Utility for Epson Stylus Printers.&quot; utility and followed instructions given and presto! 
Now I have a squeaky clean printer, with new pads, which is producing better printouts than ever before.
Many thanks for the time of putting this on-line...It has saved me a lot of money and the printer now has many more years of life  ahead of it.

many thanks,

Mario]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Forgot to mention, lights on my Stylus 1400 are both flashing, but not simultaneously. They flash alternately, which I have not found anything about. I&#039;m only assuming the sponges are full or print counter needs reset. Can anyone confirm what alternate lights flashing means for sure?
Thanks - Bryan]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just found your site and instructions for cleaning pads and running utility for resetting print counter. Looked for info specific to setup like ours, but cannot find. Can you tell me if this works for Stylus 1400 that is also fitted with QuickConnectII bulk ink bags? Thanks - Bryan]]></description>
