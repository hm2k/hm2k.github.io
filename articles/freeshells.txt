 The following is a list of a few free Unix/Linux shell account providers. These can all be accessed via telnet. The level of service and features offered by the providers listed here varies although most are pretty good (considering they arn't getting paid a whole lot). If you have a service or know of one let me know so i can add it to the list. If you're learning Unix/Linix then these are a good place to start.

Site was down.

Cost: Free Quota: 10mb Location: Texas - Plano - Benjamin Spencer Background Processes: Unknown IRC Allowed?: No Server: Apache/1.3.31 (Unix) mod_gzip/1.3.26.1a mod_throttle/3.1.2 mod_layout/3.2 mod_watch/3.17 PHP/4.3.7 mod_ssl/2.8.18 OpenSSL/0.9.7c

Shell Details: The shell account generally comes with a 5 meg soft quota, and a 10 meg hard quota of disk space. The quota is only a way to keep things in check. If more space is needed, it usually isn't a problem to get more. The shell also comes with email (popable), web space, and FTP space if you need. The shell account is pretty much needed for all other services here. I have several reasons for that.

My Comments: No further details
