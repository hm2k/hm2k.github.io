<p><strong>Malware</strong></p>
<p>To make sure your not infected with Malware or malicious software (Spyware, Trojans, Viruses, Adware, etc. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)
</p>
<p>Please follow the following instructions (always reboot when it recommends doing so):</p>
<p>1. Do you have a firewall running?<br>
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/security/internet/sp2_wfintro.mspx">Windows XP SP2</a> comes with a firewall by default which I recommend you use.<br>
  Other than that try using <a href="http://www.kerio.com/us/kpf_download.html">Kerio Personal Firewall</a>.<br>
  If you have a slow computer you can get <a href="http://www.kerio.com/dwn/kpf2-en-win.exe">KPF version 2</a>.<br>
  I believe Kerio Personal Firewall is identical to Tiny Personal Firewall and Sygate Personal Firewall.<br>
  I do not recommend using ZoneAlarm or BlackICE Defender.<br>
  To test your firewall see <a href="http://grc.com/lt/leaktest.htm">http://grc.com/lt/leaktest.htm</a> or <a href="http://www.hackerwatch.org/probe/">http://www.hackerwatch.org/probe/</a></p>
<p>2. Make sure Windows is updated.<br>
  Visit the <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/">Windows Update website</a> (Use internet explorer)<br>
  Or Start &gt; Run &gt; type: wupdmgr.exe<br>
  If you are on Windows XP, please update to SP2 or above as it has the security centre.<br>
  If you are on Windows 2000, please update to SP4 or above.</p>
<p>3. Remove any malware.<br>
  Make sure you have anti-virus software installed, I recommend Norton Antivirus or McAfee if you have a fast PC (These are not free).<br>
  Two fairly good FREE alternative Anti-Virus solutions are <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html">http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html</a> or <a href="http://free.grisoft.com/">http://free.grisoft.com/</a><br>
  Even if you have anti-virus software installed I can recommend a visit to <a href="http://housecall.trendmicro.com/">TrendMicro Housecall</a>. <br>
  HouseCall is a free online Java based anti-virus software solution provided by TrendMicro, its always a good idea to have a second opinion.<br>
  Make sure your anti-virus software is working and up-to-date.</p>
<p>Get a copy of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx">Microsoft's Antispyware Software</a>.<br>
  Its still in beta, but its far better than Ad-aware and SpyBot - Search &amp; Destroy put together.<br>
  I therefore recommend uninstalling any other anti-spyware software as sometimes they just make things worse.</p>
<p>If you think you have a specific virus/malware, try using the following:<br>
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx">The Microsoft Malware Removel Tool</a>.<br>
  <a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/tools.list.html">The Norton Virus Removal Tools</a><br>
  Both of these tools are free to download.</p>
<p>Finally if you still think your infected or simply cannot get rid of a peice of malware, you need HiJackThis.<br>
  HiJackThis will create a log that you can browse through and tell it to fix, this is a bit of an expert tool so if you are unsure, ask an expert for advise.<br>
  Get a copy of <a href="http://www.merijn.org/files/hijackthis.zip">HiJackThis</a>.<br>
  Usually you can spot the dodgy strings and select them for fixing, just be careful.</p>
<p>If you need more help with HiJackThis, it might be worth getting a copy of <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.html">ProcessExplorer</a>. <br>
  Its more powerful Task Manager, and its helpful when researching what certain processes are.</p>
