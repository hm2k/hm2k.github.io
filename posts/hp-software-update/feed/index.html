HM2k, THANK YOU, I had thought I tried EVERYTHING same scenario,
and was starting to want to go into destroy everything mode...because I&#039;m just completly baffled and ofcourse HP customer support is really good at wasting time and being unproductive in finding a useful solution...

followed your instructions to the T 
(except at the very end I figure you had a flatbed scanner, instead I got the correct driver for my HP all in one)
had the following happen when I ran setup:
was told &quot;a newer version has been found on your computer, setup will now exit&quot; 
sighs...went back to the drawing board:

had to do a little bit more homework, first thing was doublechecked the steps, ran the Windows installer clean up (after installing it) removed ALL HP stuff, then did a search on my laptop for &#039;HP&#039; and deleted EVERYTHING, then installed, it had me restart a few times still gave me the message at the end but this time before I hit ok to let it uninstall itself I decided to see if I could print, opened a document and sure enough the printer showed up so i exited the install (which was now trying to uninstall itself) and now everything works, even got a second printer connected. whew what a mission, thanks hp *shakes head*

@Ken you can get Windows Installer CleanUp Utility here:
