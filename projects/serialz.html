<h1>Serialz</h1>
<p>Serialz is an interesting and odd project.</p>
<p>Serialz is a bot designed to serve in #serialz EFnet.</p>
<p>The current version of Serialz runs on a Microsoft Windows 2000 Machine running mIRC.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of this bot the scripts are currently private. However if you are looking for a copy of Serialz, send me an email and we can discuss it further. </p>
<p>Most of the scripts Serialz runs are based on older scripts (due to standardisation) such as ClownScript, DragNScript, Notepod and CowScript.</p>
<p>Serialz also has loaded MyIP, Google, Moo, Cmds, Wget scripts loaded. </p>
<p><em>If you are trying to find a Serial, try <a href="irc://irc.efnet.net/serialz">#serialz EFnet</a>.</em></p>
