Amd Athlon 64 Winchester CPUs with Abit A8V and Asus AV8 Motherboards

As the winchester CPU is newer than the motherboard, it may not post out of the box.

For the Asus motherboards you can do the following:
1. Download the latest BIOS to a floppy and rename it to A8V.ROM.
2. Just unplug everything bar the floppy, vid card and stick one slot of ram into slot B1 ONLY.
3. Then stick the floppy in, turn on and press ALT-F2 at the BIOS screen. It will then flash it for you and normal business will resume.

As for the Abit motherboards:
1. You either need a Newcastle core chip so you can do the bios update.
2. A replacement bios, which you can either hotflash or buy
3. Get Abit (based in stevenage) or the reseller to flash it
4. In some cases you can place the ram in slot 3 (b1) and it will post, allowing you to do the bios update.
