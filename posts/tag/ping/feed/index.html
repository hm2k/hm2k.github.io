										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I&#8217;ve been meaning to publish a post about Pingotron for some time now, but now I fear it&#8217;s already too late.</em></p>
<p>Quite a few months back I was looking for an application that could sit on my desktop and tell me instantly if any of my servers had stopped responding by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping">ping</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-276"></span>There&#8217;s probably hundreds of ways of monitoring services, including paid for web services such as <a href="http://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a>, and open source software that runs on your web server such as <a href="http://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a>. None of them really hit the spot for the services I wanted to monitor, or they were expensive.</p>
<p>A quick and easy way to monitor services that was fairly non-intrusive was what I wanted. Enough detail to tell you that a server was unreachable by ping and when it happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://express-press-release.net/46/PR%20-%20Quick%20Troubleshooting%20or%20How%20to%20Be%20Always%20On%20the%20Watch.php">Pingotron</a> seemed ideal&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Pingotron</em> is a computer program for controlling and monitoring network devices, such as computers, network printers, routers and other devices, on TCP/IP networks. The program has two versions: Pingotron (basic) and Pingotron PRO.</p>
<p>A list of desired hosts that you wish to control are entered into the program.</p>
<p>The program sends ICMP “echo request” packets to each host and listens for ICMP “echo response” replies. Various properties (ping interval, size of packet, time-out request) can be configured for each host. The program can notify an administrator when a problem arises with any host with an alert sound, e-mail, blinking tray notification and/or network notification. The PRO version has an alarm history log feature, alarm statistics, and ping history and ping statistics for all hosts, in addition, it has a multi-user mode.</p></blockquote>
<p>I started to use it, however, straight away I came across an odd issue which seemed to only affect the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netgear_DG834G">DG834 series routers</a>.</p>
<p>The software reported the ping response from these routers as an &#8220;unknown response&#8221;, while in windows regular ping, they responded just fine.</p>
<p>It was clear that the software seemed to think that the response was malformed, perhaps it wass, however regular windows ping does not.</p>
<p>I emailed the details over to the author via the support email address. I got a response the same day.</p>
<p><em>Anatoly Dobrinin</em> fixed the bug, provided me with the latest PRO version download and a valid serial number to register it as a full version.</p>
<p>What a great author! I was impressed. Sure I would never have paid for this software, as there were clearly free solutions, so this was great!</p>
<p>This was last year in 2008. This year, I find that if you visit Pingotron.com you find yourself at some kind of ad filled domain parking page. Fortunately you can still find an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080720072228/http://www.pingotron.com/">archived copy of Pingotron.com</a> in the web archive.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> As Pingotron appears to be no more I have decided to share my resources&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for your message.</p>
<p>This bug has been fixed today.</p>
<p>Please download and install the program again.</p>
<p>You can download the program here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pingotron.com/setup_pro.zip">http://www.pingotron.com/setup_pro.zip</a></p>
<p>You can use this registration code to register  the pro version:</p>
<p>EET4-3EZS-VTK0-M0U7</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Anatoly Dobrinin</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Note: If Anatoly would like me to remove this, feel free to contact me.</em></p>
<p><em>A copy of <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=FMZ5OM5I">setup_pro.zip</a> can be found on megaupload.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Further Update: </strong>I had another issue that I tried to report, but since pingotron.com is unreachable, nothing can be done about it.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t a major issue. The issue was that sometimes when explorer crashes, the Pingotron icon does not reappear in the system tray.</p>
<p>There was no way to recover the icon or window, without killing the &#8220;Pingotron.exe&#8221; and restarting it. Running &#8220;Pingotron.exe&#8221; again would only give you the error &#8220;The program is already running!&#8221;.</p>
<p>I solved this by writing a script using AutoIT which would Check if the Pingotron window exists, restore it, otherwise run &#8220;Pingotron.exe&#8221;. I called it <a href="http://hm2k.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/code/autoit/Start_Pingotron.au3">Start Pingotron</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, since Pingotron is clearly no longer in active development, I am wondering is there&#8217;s anything else to use instead. Any ideas? Let me know.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;ll just end up writing my own service instead&#8230;</p>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 884px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">I noticed that sometimes when explorer crashes, the pingotron icon does not reappear in the system tray.</div>
