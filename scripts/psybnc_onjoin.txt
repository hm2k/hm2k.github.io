psyBNC Control Commands
-----------------------

Note: Please read the SCRIPTING file in the psybnc directory. 

Basically a scripts must be placed in the /home/user/psybnc/scripts/USERx.SCRIPT folder.
* Where "x" is you must put what number user you are in the psybnc.conf, usually this will be 1.

If you wanted to give ALL users the same scripts you would use DEFAULT.SCRIPT instead of USERx.SCRIPT 

For example you would "pico /home/user/psybnc/scripts/USER1.SCRIPT" and paste the code in.

---BEGIN---
server JOIN *!*@* #yourchannel * echo "MODE #f-ws +v $NICK"
---END---
After loading the scripts do: /SRELOAD on the psyBNC to activate the script.
