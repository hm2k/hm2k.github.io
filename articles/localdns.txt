How to setup local hosts on Windows XP
--------------------------------------

Go to Start > Run, type in "C:\WINDOWS\system32\notepad.exe C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" press enter or OK.

Add your host(s)...

After the block of #'s you will see:

127.0.0.1       localhost

Under that, add an entry for the server, if you are hosted on server.example.com and it has the IP 123.123.123.123, you would add:

123.123.123.123	example.com
123.123.123.123	www.example.com

Then when you visit http://www.example.com/ in a browser, it will show up as your website until global DNS is working.

This can also be used for ftp clients, simply use example.com as your ftp server, then use your username/password as normal.

Where "example.com" is used, use your domain.

If you get the message "welcome to white.phurix.com" it means your hosting package is not setup yet on our server.

NOTICE: DO NOT FORGET TO REMOVE THIS ENTRY AFTER ABOUT 48 HOURS, OTHERWISE IT MAY AFFECT FUTURE CHANGES.
