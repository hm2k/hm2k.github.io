Creating an Eggdrop Bot for IRC
-------------------------------
*** Note: This is very old ***

Please remember that most eggdrops are run on remote linux machines, NOT on windows!

This means that you will require net access to a remote linux machine,
Such as a box or a shell (http://www.falcon-networks.com/)
These usually have to be payed for, or you can get a root (which are usually illegal)

For this tutorial you will need either Microsoft Telnet or Secure CRT

Press the "start menu" and click "run"
Type "telnet" (without the quote marks) and press ok
Click "connect" and then "Remote System"
A dialog will popup, for host, type in the host supplied by your shell provider
for the port type "telnet" and TermType should be by default "vt100"
and click "Connect"

Once connected you will be asked for your "UserName" and "Password"
and then you will be taken to your home directory.
type "lynx ftp://ftp.eggheads.org/pub/eggdrop/source/1.6/eggdrop1.6.4.tar.gz"
and follow the on screen instructions

once this file is completly downloaded type: tar -zxvf eggdrop1.6.4.tar.gz
This might take a while, once this is done, type "cd eggdrop1.6.4"
Now type: "./configure" and follow the instructions.
Then type: "make" but this might take a while
Then choose what directory you want your bot to be in by typing:
"make install DEST=/home/'username'/'botname'"

Now type: "pico eggdrop.conf.dist" and edit this file according to the settings you want.
once you have done this save it as: 'botname'.conf
if you have done all this successfully you should be able to just type:
"./eggdrop -m 'botname'.conf" and there should be no problems.
If there are any problems it is most likly to do with, either the names of things, so
for example, make sure file names are in lowercase and that there are no unusual characters.
Otherwise it is probably to do with the 'botname'.conf file, so just go through it again, 
and see if there is anything unusual in there.

Once you are done with this, it should come onto IRC, once there type "/msg 'botname' hello"
then type "/dcc chat 'botname'"

You will probably need to know the following commands:
.help
.adduser 'nick'
.chattr 'nick' +o #<channel>
.chattr 'nick' +m #<channel>
.chattr 'nick' +n
.chpass 'nick' temp123
.-user 'nick'
.whois 'nick'
