<font style="color:#666; font-size:14;">Incase you hadn't noticed, I have changed HM2K.org, i've cut it down to the bare essentials, to give people exactly what they want.<br /><br />I decided to do this since I have updated a few of my scripts and released some new ones, yet found it difficult to announce, and organise.<br /><br />I have also changed the site over from a table layout to a css layout, apparently its the "in thing" to do in the internet industry, so if it looks crap in your browser don't blame me, blame the industry.<br /><br />The flash and gallery have been removed. The flash has moved over to <a href="http://www.rofl.name/">ROFL.name</a> anyway. And the gallery will probably return in private form.<br /><br />I still have a few things to sort out with the news, but that can wait for now.<br /><br />All the articles and scripts have been made a bit more openly avalible.<br /><br />The most important thing for now is the files and the projects. Over the next few months I will be creating project pages for each of the projects listed, then using this I will be releasing the various information/files via these pages.<br /><br />A few updated files that you might want to note include:<br /><a href="http://www.hm2k.org/scripts/wget.mrc">wget for mIRC</a> - A very useful script, its meant to be a (simple) version of wget for unix based systems, you can simply type: /wget [url] and it will download the file to your mirc downloads folder.<br /><a href="http://www.hm2k.org/scripts/lnks.mrc">lnks.us script</a> - Since smlnk is no longer in use, I decided to change the script to work with <a href="http://lnks.us/">lnks.us</a> run by netmunky.<br /><a href="http://www.hm2k.org/scripts/myip.mrc">MyIP lookup script</a> - whatismyip.com changed their html code *doh*, script was updated.<br /><a href="http://www.hm2k.org/files/hm2k_cjb.zip">CJB.net Updater script for mIRC</a> - Due to the myip lookup change, this script was updated.<br /><a href="http://www.hm2k.org/files/hm2k_notepod.zip">Notepod for mIRC</a> - enter a new notepod, its still in beta, but its the best and quickest notepod for mirc out there.<br />and most importantly...<br /><a href="http://www.hm2k.org/scripts/moo.mrc">moo script v3.0 *beta* (for mIRC v6.16 or above - no more moo.dll)</a> - Thats right, no need for moo.dll anymore, but it is still in beta, as there are some bugs and it can be a bit slow at times.<br /><br />(See, I have been busy. Let me know if I have missed anything.)<br /><br />Links are no more, at least for now, however I will be writing a linkback monitoring script and prises will go to people sending me the most traffic.<br /><br />Thanks and enjoy.</font></td>
