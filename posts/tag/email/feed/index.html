										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many years back I began investigating anti email spam in the UK as a way to defend against the amount amount of email spam we were receiving to certain email addresses.</p>
<p>The reason this email address was getting so much spam is because it was harvested by a website spider bot, as the email address was placed on company website by the previous webmaster.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">DO NOT put your email address or any email addresses directly on your website, instead use a form.</p>
<p>Back then there was only examples of support for US, but very little support in the UK.</p>
<p>One thing I did find was the <a href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/Consumer/Spam/default.htm">Office Of Fair Trading Spam Tips</a> but they were not very useful, the JunkBusters.com website has some nice tips on &#8220;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091027232014/http://www.junkbusters.com/junkemail.html">junk email</a>&#8220;, if only something existed like this for the UK.</p>
<p>I discovered that in the US you can send your junk/spam email to <a href="mailto:spam@ftc.gov">spam@ftc.gov</a> and they will pursue law enforcement actions against people sending the emails.</p>
<p>After I read the <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/privacy_and_electronic/introductory/rules_~1.pdf">NEW RULES ON EMAIL MARKETING</a> article, I figured I could issue a complaint with the <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints/privacy_and_electronic_communications.aspx">Information Commissioner</a> via <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints/~/media/documents/library/Privacy_and_electronic/Forms/pecr_complaints_form.doc">this form</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In 2010 the BBC offered an article entitled: &#8220;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/guides/stopping-spam-emails">How can I stop getting spam emails?</a>&#8221; which seems to offer sufficient advice, there&#8217;s also a whole heap of resources in the Dmoz &#8220;<a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/E-mail/Spam/">email spam</a>&#8221; directory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I noticed an unusual email when I checked my Gmail account today.</p>
<p>Sure it was spam, but this one was tagged with a &#8220;Password&#8221; tag, a tag that I used to filter any emails that contain an old password.</p>
<p>Low and behold there was my password displayed right in the email. So, of course, the first thing to do was to check the <a href="http://pastie.org/pastes/2003898/text">email headers</a> to see how the email was routed.</p>
<p>I could not believe it!<span id="more-2925"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>To: &#8220;password1&#8221; &lt;friendster@example.org&gt;</p>
<p><em>Note: my password is not password1, I replaced it with that.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>They had inserted my password instead of my name in the &#8220;To&#8221; part of the email headers.</p>
<p>The email address they sent to was an alias which I had used specifically for friendster so I knew. However, according to the email headers it definitely did not come from the friendster servers.</p>
<p>How did the spammers manage to get my password and email address?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve certainly not used the account since about 2005, so it can&#8217;t be me.</p>
<p>Does friendster store their passwords in plain text?</p>
<p>I figured the easiest way to check is to issue a &#8220;forgot password&#8221; request and see what happens.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s official: Friendster is a <a href="http://plaintextoffenders.com/">plain text offender</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I received an &#8220;<a href="http://pastie.org/pastes/2004005/text">Your Friendster account information</a>&#8221; email which contained my password in plain text right in the email.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/friendster-password.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2927" title="friendster password" src="http://www.hm2k.com/upload/friendster-password-300x213.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="213" srcset="https://hm2k.org/upload/friendster-password-300x213.jpg 300w, https://hm2k.org/upload/friendster-password.jpg 618w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, this means is that it is absolutely possible that if somebody <em>did </em>hack into friendster they could recover my password (and everyone elses) from their database.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for friendster?</strong></p>
<p>Well, probably not a lot since most people are waving <a href="http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/1972/bye-bye-friendster">bye-bye to friendster</a> anyway as friendster starts to delete all user data from their servers.</p>
<p><em>My tip: Don&#8217;t delay, <a href="http://www.friendster.com/cancelaccount.php">delete it today!</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Update 02/06/11</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday I emailed friendster to notify them of a serious security concern, today I received this reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank you for reporting this to us.  We take reports like this seriously  and we shall make the proper investigation on your concern.   Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t have a specific time frame on when the  investigation will be completed. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Customer Support</p></blockquote>
<p>P.S. Thanks for your comments, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not alone. Keep them coming!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2007 I wrote about<a href="http://www.hm2k.com/posts/email-address-on-your-website"> email addresses on your website</a> and how to avoid putting your email address in plain text.</p>
<p>A guy I know, named &#8220;csarven&#8221; also wrote about <a href="http://www.csarven.ca/hiding-email-addresses">methods to hide email addresses from page source</a> providing over 16 concepts for hiding your email address.</p>
<p>This was useful, but not practical, so I decided to write a PHP class&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-1891"></span>I began writing the <a href="http://obfuscate.sourceforge.net/">Obfuscate Email PHP Library</a> as a proof of concept to show the various methods in action, but then I decided to release the code as well as a demonstration website.</p>
<p>The demonstration website is based on a concept outlined by tilllate.com in their &#8220;<a href="http://techblog.tilllate.com/2008/07/20/ten-methods-to-obfuscate-e-mail-addresses-compared/">nine ways to obfuscate e-mail addresses compared</a>&#8221; article.</p>
<p>In this article the author has setup 9 different email addresses and put them on their website using 9 different obfuscation techniques.</p>
<p>They then waited one and a half years for the mailboxes to receive emails and then reviewed the results.</p>
<p>The Obfuscate project is using a very similar concept, but instead it is using a free email service to provide disposable email addresses without any configuration.</p>
<p>At first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailinator">mailinator</a> was used, however emails are kept for just a few hours which makes it almost impossible to measure results. Meanwhile the <a href="http://www.dispostable.com/">dispostable</a> service keeps email for up to two days and there is no registration required.</p>
<p>The theory is that the &#8220;plain&#8221; email address should received more email than the others and the most successful methods will receive no emails at all.</p>
<p>The project website will be indexed by the search engines and the spam bots should start to crawl the website for email addresses.</p>
<p>Now we wait for the results&#8230;</p>
<p>In the meantime you can use the <a href="http://obfuscate.sourceforge.net/">Obfuscate Email PHP Library</a> to choose one of over 16 methods of obfuscation you feel is most suitable for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is something that people don&#8217;t seem to realise, and although I tell them over and over it seems to go ignored.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT PUT YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS ON YOUR WEBSITE</strong></p>
<p>The reason is that spam bots crawl websites and gather email addresses, then place them into a list ready to spam.</p>
<p><span id="more-121"></span>People often ask me how to overcome this issue, I mainly use the following 3 methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add removable tags. (eg: web@[-REMOVE-]hm2k.org)</li>
<li>Images &#8211; Simply turn your email address into an image and include it on your site, be warned however, some spam bots use OCR, but not very often as it uses lots of resources.</li>
<li>Forms &#8211; One of the best methods, because your email address is never visible, however forms can be spammed.</li>
</ol>
<p>For those with some PHP skills here&#8217;s a simple script I made, you can use to render your email addresses, as per option 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;?php

$string=$_GET['text'];
$fixedhost=str_replace('www.','',$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']);

//check for string
if (!$string) { die(); }
$string=$string.'@'.$fixedhost;

//ensure no caching by browser - START
header("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); //A Date in the past
header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT"); // always modified
header("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate"); // no cache for HTTP/1.1
header("Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0", false); // no cache for HTTP/1.1
header("Pragma: no-cache"); // no cache for HTTP/1.0
//ensure no caching by browser - END

//output the image
header('Content-type: image/gif'); // tell the browser that this is an image

//Create the image
$font  = 3;
$width  = ImageFontWidth($font)* strlen($string);
$height = ImageFontHeight($font);
$im = ImageCreate($width,$height);

$x=imagesx($im)-$width ;
$y=imagesy($im)-$height;
$background_color = imagecolorallocate ($im, 242, 242, 242); //white background
$text_color = imagecolorallocate ($im, 0, 0,0);//black text
$trans_color = $background_color;//transparent colour
imagecolortransparent($im, $trans_color);
imagestring ($im, $font, $x, $y,  $string, $text_color);

imagegif($im);
ImageDestroy($im); 

?&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Update: I recently also write some javascript that is not easily detectable by the spam bots&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;script language=&#8221;JavaScript&#8221; type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;&gt;<br />
&lt;!&#8211;<br />
var who = &#8216;info&#8217;;<br />
var at = &#8216;@&#8217;;<br />
URL=self.location.href;<br />
prefix=URL.substring(0,URL.indexOf(&#8216;.&#8217;)+1);<br />
URLremain=URL.substring(prefix.length,URL.length);<br />
domain=&#8221;;<br />
if((prefix==&#8217;http://www.&#8217;) || (prefix==&#8217;www.&#8217;)) {<br />
domain=URLremain.substring(0,URLremain.indexOf(&#8216;/&#8217;));<br />
}<br />
else {<br />
prefix2=URL.substring(0,7);<br />
if (prefix2==&#8217;http://&#8217;) {<br />
URLremain2=URL.substring(prefix2.length,URL.length);<br />
domain=URLremain2.substring(0,URLremain2.indexOf(&#8216;/&#8217;));<br />
}<br />
else{ domain=URL.substring(0,URL.indexOf(&#8216;/&#8217;)); }<br />
}<br />
document.write(who + at + domain);<br />
//&#8211;&gt;<br />
&lt;/script&gt;</p></blockquote>
<p>It pulls the domain name automatically, ideal for many simple sites.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other techniques, csarven has a very nice article detailing these, called <a href="http://www.csarven.ca/hiding-email-addresses">hiding email addresses</a>.</p>
