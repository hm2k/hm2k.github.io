<p><b>Analysis of Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</b></p>
<p><strong>Initial findings:</strong></p>
<p>SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS (34 letters) from the movie Mary Poppins 
  is not the longest word in English, although many people believe it is. In fact 
  pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is.</p>
<p>The word Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is in the Oxford English Dictionary, 
  which has the following as the first four citations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1949 Parker &amp; Young (unpublished song-title) Supercalafajalistickespialadojus.</li>
  <li> 1951 Parker &amp; Young (song-title) Supercalafajalistickespeealadojus; 
    or, The super song. </li>
  <li>1964 R. M. &amp; R. B; Sherman (song-title) Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! 
  </li>
  <li>1967 Decisions U.S. Courts involving Copyright 1965-66 488 The complaint 
    alleges copyright infringement of plaintiff's song `Supercalafajalistickespeealadojus' 
    by defendants' song 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.' (All variants of 
    this tongue twister will hereinafter be referred to collectively as 'the word'.)</li>
</ul>
<p> (The definition says Disney won, &quot;in view of earlier oral uses of the 
  word sworn to in affidavits&quot; and because they wrote the rest of the song 
  themselves.) </p>
<p>All 34 letters of this word were made up for the movie, Mary Poppins, by a 
  writing team of two brothers, Bob and Dick Sherman. Their most famous song is 
  &quot;It's a Small World,&quot; which they wrote for the World's Fair in New 
  York in 1964. You can hear it on the ride of the same name at Disneyland. The 
  Shermans wrote all the songs for Mary Poppins, including &quot;A Spoonful of 
  Sugar,&quot; &quot;Feed the Birds&quot; and &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee.&quot; &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; 
  means nothing, really. It is a very long nonsense word that is made up to sound 
  like you are terribly smart and &quot;You'll always sound precocious.&quot; 
  Now we use it to mean that something is fantastic or super-fabulous.</p>
<p>The Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious song lyrics from the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; 
  movie are as follows:<br>

<p class="lyrics">Mary Poppins:<br>
  So when the cat has got your tongue<br>
  There's no need for dismay<br>
  Just summon up this word<br>
  And then you've got a lot to say<br>
  But better use it carefully<br>
  Or it could change your life</p>
<p class="lyrics">The Perlie:<br>
  One night I said it to me girl<br>
  And now me girl's my wife!</p>

<p><strong>Further analasys:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em></strong> can be split up 
  in a number of ways, we chose this: <em>&quot;Super&quot;, &quot;Cali&quot;, 
  &quot;Fragilistic&quot;, &quot;Expialidocious&quot;.</em></p>
<p><strong>Super...</strong><br>
  - Higher than another in rank, station, or authority: a superior officer. <br>
  - Of a higher nature or kind. <br>
  - Of great value or excellence; extraordinary. <br>
  - Greater in number or amount than another: an army defeated by superior numbers 
  of enemy troops. <br>
  - Affecting an attitude of disdain or conceit; haughty and supercilious. <br>
  - Above being affected or influenced; indifferent or immune: &#8220;Trust magnates 
  were superior to law&#8221; (Gustavus Myers). <br>
  - Located higher than another; upper.</p>
<p>Analysis so far: Super meaning Superior, ie: Superior Officer.</p>
<p><strong>Cali...</strong> This could mean 1 of 3 things...<br>
  - A city of western Colombia on the Cali River southwest of Bogot&aacute;. It 
  was founded in 1536. Population: 1,369,331.<br>
  - (Hindoo Myth.) The tenth avatar or incarnation of the god Vishnu. [Written 
  also Kali.]<br>
  - Abbreviation for California</p>
<p>Analysis so far: A Californian Superior Officer.</p>
<p><strong>Fragilistic:</strong><br>
  I still haven't worked this one out entirly, but we were thinking its to do 
  with multiplayer games or more feasably to do with killing, deriving from the 
  word &quot;Frag&quot;<br>
  - A fragmentation grenade.<br>
  - To wound or kill (a fellow soldier) by throwing a grenade or similar explosive 
  at the victim: &#8220;He got fragged. Blown away&#8221; (Bobbie Ann Mason). 
  <br>
  - [from Vietnam-era U.S. military slang via the games Doom and Quake] 1. To 
  kill another player's avatar in a multiuser game. &quot;I hold the office Quake 
  record with 40 frags.&quot; 2. To completely ruin something. &quot;Forget that 
  power supply, the lightning strike fragged it.</p>
<p>Analysis so far: A Californian Superior Officer killed or wounded.</p>
<p><strong>Expialidocious:</strong><br>
  The hardest one yet, still little understanding of what this word means, or 
  even what it could derive from.</p>
<p>Dictionary.com returned the following for &quot;<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=expialidocious">expialidocious</a>&quot;:</p>
<p>Did you mean exploits?<br>
  Suggestions:<br>
  exploits<br>
  explodes</p>
<p>Keeping with the theme of &quot;Fragilistic&quot; I realised that &quot;Expialidocious&quot; 
  must have something to do with &quot;explodes&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Final Summary</strong></p>
<p> <em><strong>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</strong></em> actually means: 
  A Californian Superior Officer exploded by a fragmentation grenade.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusison:</strong><br>
  The Mary Poppins movie, Walt Disney and Bob and Dick Sherman arn't as innocent 
  as we first perceived and that maybe as the song so rightly says &quot;the sound 
  of it is something quite atrocious.&quot; is actually closer to the truth than 
  you think.</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> I can't remember where I got *all* the information 
  from, but I am sure if you just use google you'll be able to find it.</em></p>
