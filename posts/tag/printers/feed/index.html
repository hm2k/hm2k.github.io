<blockquote><p>Outlook Express won&#8217;t print.</p></blockquote>
<p>I log in and take a look. Everything seems normal, and normal documents appear to print.</p>
<p>However, when I click the print button or go to File &gt; Print nothing happens. Strange.</p>
<p>They are running Windows XP Professional SP2, with IE6.</p>
<p><span id="more-216"></span></p>
<p>All you have to do is go to Start &gt; Run and issue the following commands:</p>
<blockquote><p>regsvr32 vbscript.dll<br />
regsvr32 jscript.dll</p></blockquote>
<p>Once this is done, restart Outlook Express/Internet Explorer, and go ahead and print.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time i&#8217;ve seen this issue, so I thought I&#8217;d note it down for next time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I decided I was finally fed up with my Epson Stylus C46 bubble jet printer, and decided that I don&#8217;t really need it anyway.</p>
<p>Everything I print only needs to be in black and white, and anything else I can print onto the HP Photosmart 3110 All-in-one that I have located in the room on another machine.</p>
<p>So now it&#8217;s time to get serious, I decided to use a Samsung ML-4500 laser jet I had lying around spare.</p>
<p>Only, how do you install this thing on Windows XP?</p>
<p><span id="more-195"></span></p>
<p>Yes, I plugged it in, powered it up, and connected the printer cable to my machine&#8217;s LPT port.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not plug and play so I had to invoke &#8220;Add Hardware&#8221; from within control panel.</p>
<p>It knew what it was straight away and detected it as a &#8220;Samsung ML-4500&#8221;, but displayed the &#8220;Unknown device&#8221; icon next it.</p>
<p>No driver can be found, &#8220;cannot install this hardware&#8221; is displayed&#8230; Time to locate the driver&#8230;</p>
<p>First port of call is the Samsung USA website after a quick google for &#8220;Samsung ML-4500 XP driver&#8221;, which displayed the FAQ &#8220;<a href="http://erms.samsungusa.com/customer/sea/jsp/faqs/faqs_view.jsp?PG_ID=1&amp;AT_ID=8188&amp;PROD_SUB_ID=29&amp;PROD_ID=29">ML-4500 I Don&#8217;t Have Windows XP Driver And Cannot Print.</a>&#8220;, and an <a href="http://www.samsungusa.com/UPLOAD/ecms/sw/20030828190257140_20010927112109ML4500English.exe">ML-4500 Driver</a> (20030828190257140_20010927112109ML4500English.exe) is provided.</p>
<p>Downloading this driver, I find that it&#8217;s a setup process, which doesn&#8217;t work, and I get the following error:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: Courier New;">An error occurred during the move process: -115<br />
Component: 2000DIR2<br />
File Group: 2000_DIR<br />
File: C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\w32x86\2\ssgk2.dll</span></p></blockquote>
<p>A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22An+error+occurred+during+the+move+process:+-115%22">quick google</a> tells me that i&#8217;m not alone with this <a href="http://www.computergripes.com/samsung.ml4500.html">problem</a>, however, the results are outdated&#8230; So what now?</p>
<p>I decide to visit Samsung&#8217;s site directly, and <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/function/search/resultList.do?searchWord=ML-4500">SEARCH</a>. There I found a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/download/supportDown.do?model_nm=ML-4500&amp;mType=DR&amp;vType=L&amp;disp_nm=ML-4500">download center page for the ML-4500</a>. There the <a href="http://org.downloadcenter.samsung.com/downloadfile/ContentsFile.aspx?CDSite=us&amp;CttFileID=39612&amp;CDCttType=DR&amp;ModelType=N&amp;ModelName=ML-4500&amp;language=&amp;cate_type=all&amp;VPath=DR/200506/20050617120952218_ML-4500series_english.exe">ML-4500 Printer Driver (ver.1.61)</a> (20050617120952218_ML-4500series_english.exe) is provided.</p>
<p>This downloads and runs fine, but strangely installs to &#8220;C:\Windows\Samsung\ML4500&#8221;.</p>
<p>At this point, if it has worked correctly, you should find that in &#8220;Printers and Faxes&#8221; under control panel, you now have a new &#8220;Samsung ML-4500 Series&#8221; printer.</p>
<p>Going into properties, and printing a &#8220;Test Page&#8221; should prove that it worked successfully!</p>
<p>I know I have quite a few ML-4500&#8217;s lying around different places, so I&#8217;m certain this will be useful to me in future, if not others&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Final thought: Why don&#8217;t hardware manufacturers SEO their sites especially their </em><em>driver downloads</em><em>? This could all have been avoided if the right results showed up in the first place.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I had the joy of fixing an Epson Stylus C46 UX printer.</p>
<p>It had the following error: &#8220;Parts inside your printer are at the end of their service life. See your printer documentation.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a little searching I discovered that most people were saying that &#8220;It is simply not worth repairing&#8221;, however, I took that as a challange, and decided that if I was going to throw it away anyway I might as well try to fix it first.</p>
<p>Before long I located a page on <a href="http://www.fixyourownprinter.com/forums/inkjet/14116">fixyourownprinter.com</a>&#8216;s forum, which had plenty of details about similar issues.</p>
<p>This is the process I used after reading details on that page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unplug the power and USB cables from the printer.</li>
<li>Prepare your work area by putting scrap paper down. Have some spare, just incase. You may also require tissue paper. It is also recommended you use protective gloves as the ink will stain your skin for quite some time.</li>
<li>Unscrew the screw at the back of the printer.</li>
<li>There are two or three tabs at the back and two at the front. Gently push them in, and then using a bit of force pry apart the cover.</li>
<li>At the back of the unit you need to locate some white pads, or sponge type things, initially they will seem fine, but they will infact be full of ink. You need to grab a pair of pliers and pull them out one by one, there should be four, put them on your scrap paper.</li>
<li>Take the scrap paper with the pads on to your sink, turn on the hot tap and hold each one under the tap using the pliers until the water runs clear. If you have protective gloves on it may be worth squeezing the water out also.</li>
<li>It is recommended that once you have done this, you let them dry.</li>
<li>Now return the pads back into the printer.</li>
<li>Put the printer back together, (mind out for the paper alignment, and give it some force), not forgetting the screw at the back.</li>
<li>Plug in the USB and power cable and turned it ON. (Yes the lights will still flash)</li>
<li>Download and install the <a href="http://www.ssclg.com/epsone.shtml">SSC Service Utility for Epson Stylus Printers</a>.</li>
<li> Select your printer and model number (There is no Stylus C42 UX, so select Stylus C4x), then close the window.</li>
<li>If it asks if you replaced with the pads; say “YES”. Then close the window.</li>
<li>You will see a SSC Service Utilitiy icon (it looks like a printer) in the system tray (next to your click), and LEFT click.</li>
<li>A menu will appear, from here you can click on &#8220;Protection counter&#8221; (its a red cross), then &#8220;reset protection counter&#8221;.</li>
<li>Turn the printer power OFF, wait 10 seconds and then turn it back ON.</li>
</ol>
<p>Done!</p>
<p><em>Additional troubleshooting&#8230; </em></p>
<p>If you have problems with paper feed, take it apart again, check everything is in place correctly, push things together tightly, and put it together again.</p>
<p>If you have trouble with print quality, open the lid, clean any ink residue, use the SSC Service Utilitiy to clean the heads.</p>
