					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I&#039;m currently at school and the IT staff here are pretty useless - I&#039;ve been able to get the FTP logins using Cain and able after connecting to the router on my personal netbook...

					<description><![CDATA[haha. good story.  I think all of the geeky kids have at least one story where they messed with school officials due to bordem.  

Back when my middle school had Microsoft word for dos I would login to classmates accounts and create &quot;macros&quot; that were mapped onto regular keys such as &quot;a&quot;.  Record macro that said &quot;Error 414&quot; or recorded a macro that randomly backspaced on different lines. Hilarious stuff, but my friends got in trouble for it for yapping that they knew how to do it.  I never got in trouble though.

Then again in college I decided to modify autoexec.bat to reformat the drive upon the next reboot just to see how long it takes a tech to fix the problem.  A week later and they decided it was a bad hard drive and replaced it.]]></description>
