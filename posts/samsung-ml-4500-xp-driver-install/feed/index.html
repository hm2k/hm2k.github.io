					<description><![CDATA[Thank a lot!

Just dug this printer out of strage cos my other samsung&#039;s toner died... but went to this link

http://www.samsung.com/us/support/detail/supportPrdDetail.do?menu=SP01&#038;prd_ia_cd=&#038;prd_mdl_cd=&#038;prd_mdl_name=ML-4500

I installed the 1.61 XP version and is working fine, no errors and took about 3 seconds... it also has drivers for Win7 and eveything else... if the link dies go to the US site and look for ML-4500 at the moment they are still suporting this great little printer.

Thanks again ^_^]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting pages. Many thanks. I have tried installing various versions (inc. v.1.61 driver) of the ML4500 driver but still no luck. I am using a Best Connectivity USB to Printer (parallel) cable which I have assigned to USB001 in the port allocation tab of the printer. When I send a print job the printer sounds like it will begin printing but nothing ever is produced. Any ideas?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this page, and particularly for your Nov 14th post. Searching on the Samsung site fails now to find this page. But it&#039;s still there as the link shows, and what&#039;s more, there is a Vista/Win 7 driver included in the list!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This writeup on on driver installation for SAMSUNGML-4500 is just very amazing and helpful. I had ,for some time, found it difficult to download driver   to use my printer  but reading this article about twenty minutes ago. I decided to try the method of clicking &quot; download center page for the ML-4500.&quot; directly from this page , and before I knew it , I had successfully down loaded it and I am now ablbe to print. 
Thanks for the information

					<description><![CDATA[I had a look at this, you can view it via the wayback machine here:

http://web.archive.org/web/20071026033608/http://erms.samsungusa.com/customer/sea/jsp/faqs/faqs_view.jsp?PG_ID=1&amp;AT_ID=8188&amp;PROD_SUB_ID=29&amp;PROD_ID=29

The link to the actual EXE appears to be dead.

What&#039;s wrong with the driver link in the main article? :

http://www.samsung.com/us/support/download/supportDown.do?model_nm=ML-4500&amp;mType=DR&amp;vType=L&amp;disp_nm=ML-4500]]></description>
