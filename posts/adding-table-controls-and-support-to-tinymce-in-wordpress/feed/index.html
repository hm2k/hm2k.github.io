I have tried the instructions above and the instructions on the link shown above as well.  Anyone else having issues?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Stian: see the comment on modifying the lang files here: www.allchorn.com/2008/09/19/how-to-implement-table-editing-in-wordpress/

@Rod: make sure you add the tablecontrols to the array named &quot;$mce_buttons_3&quot; NOT &quot;$mce_buttons&quot;. That puts the controls on a new row below the others, fixing the problem of buttons overlapping the Save and Publish area. I&#039;m not sure about the grayed-out buttons problem; I haven&#039;t experienced that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, I did the patch.  The TinyMCE version in wordpress 2.6.2 (latest) is 3.1.1, but the version I downloaded from TinyMCE was 3.2.  Now, in the WP page I am editing, I get the table buttons, but all of them are grayed out except the one for adding a table.  So, I can add a table, but not adjust it, unless I do it in HTML.

Another problem is that the visual edit box is now extended over the Save and Publish buttons, rendering them inaccessible.  I can switch to HTML mode, and then they are revealed.

What&#039;s up with the grayed out boxes?  Any help would be appreciated!

					<description><![CDATA[I get it to work, but the table editor do not show the legends correctly. In stead of &quot;Cols&quot; and &quot;Rows&quot;, I get {#table_dlg.cols} and {#table_dlg.rows} – any solution to this?]]></description>
