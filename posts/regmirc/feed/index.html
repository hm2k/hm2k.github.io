					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using mIRC since 96, and I&#039;ve never bothered to register it.  I&#039;m just a cheap bastard.  I can live with nag screens ;)

One of these day&#039;s I&#039;ll pay for a license.  Just glad enough have purchased licenses to keep the client running all these years.  I think I&#039;ll make it my goal to pay before the end of the year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t afford the license so I didn&#039;t buy it for like 10 years now.
Following a bet with HM2K, being _very_ skeptic I would even get a reply at all, I decided to email Khaled, stating who I am and that I couldn&#039;t pay for a license - and asked for a free license.
The dude gave me one - without asking any questions - after couple hours, maybe even less.
I lost the bet, Khaled rocks, and you guys should purchase mIRC if you can!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Registering mIRC is still as easy as using the keygen. The only difference now is you have to register in someones name who has already registered. I used the same keygen and just used a common name that I was sure would be registered and it worked.]]></description>
