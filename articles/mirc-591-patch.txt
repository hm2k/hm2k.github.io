How to patch mIRC32.exe to stop responding to CTCP VERSION
----------------------------------------------------------
OK, the one reason for this is that I get asked how to do this all the time,
and i'm fed up of saying the same thing, so here it is!

To remove the CTCP VERSION reply from mIRC 5.91 within mIRC use the following command:

ON WinNT/2k/XP:
//rename mirc32.exe x | copy x mirc32.exe | bwrite mirc32.exe 1365720 x
Then restart mIRC
OR
ON Win9x:
//copy mirc32.exe mirc33.exe | bwrite mirc33.exe 1365720 x
then exit mirc, delete mirc32.exe, rename mirc33.exe to mirc32.exe and load it up agian

It actually uses the /bwrite command within mIRC to patch it.

The real reason for posting it is that Khaled tries so hard to hide away the CTCP version reply,
Whats the point, When it can easily and simply be patched within mIRC.
He even has the cheek to put: Editing out the version reply, huh? :)
Inside mIRC32.exe so that when you read it in a hex editor or such, you see that...

Wanna know how to stop other CTCP responces? Place: 
ctcp *:*:*: halt
in your remotes somewhere and then you will have no CTCP responces
But be warned, some IRC Servers require a CTCP reply and also,
Oh and If you want a Fake VERSION reply use:
ctcp 1:*:*: if ($1 == VERSION) { .ctcpreply $nick $1 HM2K's IRC Client | halt }
in your remotes

Remember Khaled worked hard on mIRC, so give the guy a little credit...
Don't take out the version reply unless you really have too...

-Thanx tonix for the /bwrite command
