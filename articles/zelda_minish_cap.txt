The Legend of Zelda - The Minish Cap (ASCII title provided by Naomi Frosdick).

This FAQ/Walkthrough is copyright of Alan Quirino (grayfox_2510 (at) hotmail 
(dot) com).

Ok, so let us go over a few basic things...

Ownership, Borrowing Info, Contributing, etc.:

1) Please do not take any of this without my consent or at the very least,
   without a written gratitude in wherever you posted this. I had to spend
   quite some time getting all there is to this, or at least as close as
   possible, and well, if you have written any document of this kind and
   someone took something without gratitude then you must know it sucks... 

2) Taking up part of the previos point, if you wish to take some information
   from my guide, then make it reasonable... I mean, don't take a whole 
   section. Nonetheless, give credit where it's due; golden rule of 
   GameFAQs.com. I don't mind if I'm not told, as long as I'm given credit
   for what I did to contribute.

3) So, you notice a similarity between my guide and a piece of someone's else
   but it looks out of place? What do you do? Simple, just let me know. 
   It might be a coincidence, it might be plagiarize, who knows, but I'll 
   contact the other author and find what's going on. Thank you for the 
   support if you do notice this by the way.

4) I try, but perhaps my efforts alone are not enough and thus I end up 
   missing something here or there. Contributions are of course welcome, but
   be sure to be looking at the latest version, which is always found here:
   http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/recognition/8373.html
   Or just to be sure, hit Ctrl+F5 while viewing this file to ensure it's not
   a cached version. Also, be sure to put "Yakusoku no Chi Riviera" or the 
   like as the subject of your mail. If you wish for me to put you under a
   special name, include so. I normally also include e-mails just for
   reference, but if you want otherwise, then please let me know.

Permission, Posting, etc.:

1) First and foremost, I am NOT allowing other sites to post my works. The only
   sites that are allowed to host this is GameFAQs.com, and on the rare 
   occasion GameSpot, but that's since they, and only they can directly link
   to the former site. So save us both our time and do not ask for permission
   to post this.

2) So, assuming you inded had permissiong to post this... Do not change the
   format, the font size, the font... Nothing. Why? Simple, the whole basis
   of this guide is based on the current format, so changing it will simply
   corrupt the whole file or make it hard to read. 

3) Pay note that this is a free FAQ/Walkthrough. I make nothing out of this,
   so why should you? In other words, don't charge people for this. If I
   allowed this to be on display in your site, it must be free. Do not go
   around distributing this asking for money either. In short, don't get
   money at all for this...

4) Yes, I do get questions about this... You are free to download this and
   store it on your computer. No problem with that, just be careful with the
   format unless you want to have trouble reading. But if you want to e-mail
   me for any reason, make sure you are using the latest version...

Mailing, Inquires, etc.:

1) Ok, first of all, go to the TOC (Table of Contents). Then look at it
   again, and again a third time. Sorry for stressing that out, but most often
   the answers to your questions can be found in a particular section of the
   guide. Make sure you are also viewing the latest version, which will always
   be found at:
   http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/recognition/8373.html
   Hit Ctrl+F5 to make sure you aren't seeing a cached version. That aside,
   if you still need to contact me for an inquire, then put a subject relevant
   to the game such as, but not limited to "Yakusoku no Chi Riviera."
   {No Subject) mails will be deleted 90% of the time, so...

2) In addition to the previous point, I reserve the right to answer or not, and
   as such, I will only answer questions that I missed to detail here at all,
   or extreme cases. Mails asking about information that is already found here 
   might, and probably will end up in the trash can on my mail account. 

3) A few things though, use proper grammar and spelling for all that is holy.
   Even if the answer can be found here, the odds of me answering a mail like
   those will raise if you took the time to write properly. Now, I understand
   not everyone knows English, heck, even mine ain't that good, but if so,
   say so. Is that so much to ask?

4) Lastly, I check my mail around twice a day. Some times even more, but on 
   the rare occasion, allow up to two business days for a reply. If they are
   gone and you haven't heard back from me, then either the mail got lost, both
   mine or yours. That, or I ignored your mail for X reason, such as, but not
   limited to: Crappy grammar, inquires already answered here, etc.

So what if it's a long TOS, it needs to be done nowadays... *Rolls eyes*

[000]------------------------00. To do & Updates-------------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Ok, basically, this section denotes what I still have to finish (In more depth 
than the above section) and with what I could use help.

To do:
 -> Perhaps some sidequests...

Updates:
 -> 1.5: Updated TOS and the SideQuest section.
 -> 1.3: Hmm... Ok, it seems the Heart Piece section is complete... Other than
         that, I corrected some stuff here and there.
         Added the Sidequests section.
 -> 1.1: Ok, done revising the walkthrough for name changes I believe. Still
         missing that deam Heart Piece. I also corrected the Tiger Scrolls
         section. Apparently I duplicated an upgrade with different stuff
         for some reason... I got all the Kinfusions done!
 -> 1.0: European version released. Working to change all the names, add the
         story summary, redo parts of the walkthrough, add the info for each
         figurine... Oh yeah, also updated stuff like the Tiger Scroll
         section. Just one more heart piece to go and 2 Kinfusions left~
 -> 0.9: Some more hearts and all the figurines, plus some more fusions.
 -> 0.8: Added a few more figurines, started the Kinfusion list and updated 
         the Skills section in which I apparently missed one and some more
         Heart Pieces.
 -> 0.7: Added almsot every figurine and their translated names with as much
         as my crappy self-taught Jp allowed me to... And my programs.
         Some more Heart Pieces.
 -> 0.6: Added some more heart pieces, added the Skills section and filled in
         some items I was missing.

 -> 0.5: Started it all... Did all the walkthrough in two days. Yes, two days 
         and then started to do the rest.

[001]-----------------------------01. Story------------------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
A long, long time ago...
When the world was on the verge of being swallowed by shadow...
The tiny Picori appeared from the sky, bringing the hero of men a sword and a
 golden light.
With wisdom and courage, the hero drove out the darkness.
When peace had been restored, the people enshrined that blade with care.

-------------------------------03. Walkthrough---------------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now, before we begin, let me say that I first wrote this based on the Jp
version. I then started to go again through the game in english and thus
rewriting most of this. But, if I left some terms from the Jp version remain 
here, please let me know.

For now, if you see Pikoru, it means Picori. MAV was supposed to be the Gust
Jar, and the Patch Cane is the Cane of Pacci. (Which strangely enough, Pacci
written in katakana is basically patch, but...)
_______________________________________________________________________________
[031]---------------------03.01. Big Earth Element-----------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Ok, first things first, we gotta start a new file... So load up the catridge, 
start and make a new file. I named my character Link just for the sake of 
obviousness... 

After the first scenes detailing the story ends you'll see Zelda go inside the
house there and speak to the Master Smith about how she wants to take Link to
the Picoru Festival. You'll wake up soon afterwards. Head down and take the
Smith's Sword. Before you go out however, take the 20 rupees there. And go out,
follow her north to Hyrule Town.

Once in Hyrule Town, follow her as well, talking to her wherever she stops. 
She will then win you a Shield. After modeling it, feel free to equip it. And 
take Zelda to the northern part of the town to reach the Hyrule's Castle 
Fields. Go north and deflect the nut of the Deku Scrub using your shield. 
Proceed north to the castle. After the few scenes, and the introduction of this
game's villian, well, just watch... It's name in JP is Gufuu by the way and
the name for the english version is Vatii.

Once it's over and you are sleeping, hit A to wake up and exit the room. After 
some more dialogue you'll get the Broken Picori Blade, and a Smith's Sword (The
latter which you can now equip and use). You will also get a map, in which I'm 
sure you noted the red, flashing checkmark. Keep heading south on the castle to
leave it. Head south in the castle field and surprise, you can't go through... 
So head right from the carpenters instead and cut the small trees with a quick 
swipe to go through.

Welcome to LonLon Ranch.

Start heading down, being careful with the mole enemies. Go past the entrance 
to the farm and down another screen. Go down the set of stairs directly in 
front of you and keep heading south until you see a bridge to your right. Take
it to reach the... Minish Woods. Head right from the start until you 
have the choice to head north or south, you can't do anything heading north so 
take the south path instead. 

Once you reach the stump head left and immediately up then left again to hear a
call for help. First though, head left for a heart piece, then head 
back to the stump and straight north to reach the area. Save the weird talking
hat from those two enemies. After the talk start heading south, the hat will 
follow you. Keep heading south, and repeat it again to finally make it go on 
top of you. Now head south to the stump. By the way, his name is Ezlo, or 
Ezero if you wish from the Jp version.

So basically, jump on the stump by moving onto it and once you are atop it, 
press the R button to shrink yourself. At this size, and at this current point 
of the game, you can't go into shallow waters, it'll be the same as if you'd go
into deep waters as normal Link.

Proceed left and into the wooden log with a hole carved in it. Time yourself to
board the leaves floating in the water and head north to the Minish Town of
the Pikoru of course. Head north to trigger a small event then head all the 
way north to a house surrounded by water. Talk to the Picori inside, his name
is Festari. He mentions how you might have trouble with their language and that
a Jabber Nut could help you.

Go right and take the path down, using the bridge that should be to your right 
almost immediately to enter a house. Go north and push the box to a side to get
the weird looking red seed, the Jabber Nut... So go back to the Picori 
we just talked to. Head out and go left now to a house with a set of green 
stairs. Climb up and talk to the sage-looking Pikoru. He's actually the
elder of this village and will tell you that to reforge the blade, you will
need the four elements. He will then mark their locations on your map.

Head back to the middle house but take the upper right path to reach a Heart
Piece, then go back Festari and he'll move aside, granting you passage to
the Deepwood Shrine.

First, head north and push the statue aside to enter the doorway. In the next 
room kill the slugs and then step on all the switches to light the torches. 
Open the chest for a small key and use it on the door to go through.

In the next room head north to the lever. After a quick explanation, use the R 
button to pull it and move back to make the bridge appear. Grab the mushroom 
with the R button as well and move back as much as you can, then let go of the 
directional pad (Keep holding down the R button). This will launch you to the 
other side. Remember this for later use, you'll see more of these mushrooms.

In the next room first head right to a set of stairs, go up them and after 
another talk hit the switch. Then go down and inside the barrel, taking the 
other exit inside. You can't harm the mushrooms for now, so avoid them. Simply 
go down to be able to go up the stairs, move the statue over one of the 
swtiches and step on the other to liberate the barrel from its restrains.

Go inside the barrel again. This time when you move north or south the barrel 
will spin. Directly from where you are start walking south and eventually the 
barrel will spin enough so you'll hit the exit. Head west from there to the 
next room. Grab the mushroom and pull it back all the way, go up the stairs 
and get the Dungeon Map. Then go back down and jump off.

Grab the mushroom but pull it only until the first mark in the floor ends, this
will launch to the place between the two arches.

Enter the left room and hit the switch if you wish, even though it won't be of 
use. After another explanation, kill the enemies and push the vase into the 
switch (Read: push). Cross to the other side and enter the next room. Push any 
statue into the switch next to it. Then pull back the other one (Grab with the 
R button) just a space, then go to the other side and pull it back into the 
switch so you'll be inside the square when the chest appears to get a key. 
Head back to the barrel room and take the upper right exit inside the barrel 
(Spin it if necessary).

Head right and pull the mushroom only until the mark in the floor ends. Then 
hit the switch to make the bridge extend. Then pull this mushroom all the 
way back and enter the door to your right. Kill all the slugs and pull the 
right statue all the way back, then push the left one into the switch to go
through.

Kill the 3 beetles to get a key and proceed left. Now head up the stairs and 
jump off to your right. Go through the arch and go through the stairs at the 
top of the room. You can't do much here, except grabbing the big chest with 
the Compass inside.

Go back up and enter the left room. Careful here, there are mushrooms hiding in
the spore-covered floor. Hit the switch and keep moving left to unlock the door
and prepare for a mini boss.

Basically, a giant caterchipillar. Hit the face with your sword first and it'll
petrify. Once the tail goes into a red color unleash as many slashes with your
sword as you can. After it recovers the whole worm will go red and start 
running like crazy. Once it cools down as well repeat the process. Open the 
chest that will then appear for the Gust Jar.

This thing is basically a vacuum with a dark hole inside. Simply hold down the 
button you have it equipped to to start sucking anything inside. Try it out in 
the spiderweb blocking the southern exit of the room. You can also suck the 
spores from the floor and if used to suck in the mushrooms, you'll dazzle them,
you can hit them at this time to kill them. 

If you headed south, you'll get a Heart Piece. In the room adjacent to the 
miniboss one, start blowing the spores in the floor right when you start. You 
should uncover a switch that'll make a mini chest appear that contains 10 sea 
shells (I'll explain their use later). Two squares to the left there's another
switch, which will also give you 10 seashells.

If you go right in this room and suck in the spores between the torches you'll 
uncover another switch for a chest with 20 seashells. Now head back to the 
left.

If you head to the door in the south of the south, there's another switch 
covered in spores, exactly 3 squares away from the other switch.

This will make a blue portain appear in the structure above you. Head back to 
the entrance by going south from this room and take the portal for another 
Heart Piece. Take the panel back to the entrance and clear the left staircase 
from the spiderweb to go in. Push the block below the chest to get 20 rupees. 
Back to the barrel room, take the upper left exit inside the barrel and clear 
the spores in the floor for a switch to reach a chest with 10 seashells.

Now go back inside the barrel. You should have noticed an opening in the 
middle covered with a spiderweb; clear it, and then fall through while the 
opening is exactly in the middle of the screen.

See the lillypad in front of you? Use the Gust Jar to pull it in, then board 
it and use the air projectiles the Gust Jar sends to move. 
Keep following the only path and take the right passage when possible. Go
up the stairs and push a vase atop the switch, the take the new path that 
opened up with the lillypad. In the next screen move the lillypad all the way 
on the water, so you can use it as a bridge so that when you press the switch 
with a vase, you can use the lillypad to cross the water in order to grab the 
chest with another Small Key.

Now, using the lillypad again, go back to the fork where you took the right 
path (right before the place where you had to push a vase atop a switch in 
order to go through). This time however, keep going north and left right away 
for a locked door.

In the next room, pull the mushroom to your south and jump to the floor in the 
north. Here, stand in front of the mushroom and use the Jar to suck it in and 
then let go of the button so you'll be thrown to the other side. Repeat this 
process until you land in front of the big chest and get the Boss Key. Press 
the switch here to make a red portal open up.

Clear the spiderweb on the right stairs and go up. Use the Jar to suck in the 
mushroom and head left, then go down and use it again to head to the boss room.

Ok, big slime... Right... First, use the Jar at the base of the enemy to suck 
all that jell-o into nothingness. After a while that thing will lose balance 
and will drop, use the time to slash it's head to kingdom come. Repeat. You'll
get the Earth Elemental. Grab the Heart and take the green panel.

Go back to the Picori town and to the elder in the upper left part of town. He
says that you should look for Melari, a Minish of unsurpassable knowledge in
these things apparently. He will then open a path for you to leave town.

Enter the mushroom house out there to receive a Bomb Bag. Go back to normal 
size in the stump there. Head north and activate the Wing Crest there. You 
won't use this for a while however. You'll need the Ocarina of Windfirst 
and that's a long ways off.

Head left and down, break the rocks with a bomb and change screens to your 
left. Head north (Don't bother with the mushroom for now) and go left. Bomb 
the wall here if you want to get 20 seashells. Go up and and bomb the rocks for
a quick route back to the forest if you wish, but head left instead for the 
fields of Link's house. Go up to town and watch the pseudo-cat-looking person 
give a Kinstone bag. Once the thought bubble with the heart appears, use the L
button to open up the Kinstone combination screen. You only have one Kinstone, 
so use it.

Well, just for short, Kinstones are basically medallions. You get them in 
chests, killing enemies or from grass and stuff you can cut/break. Some persons
have those thought bubbles; use the L button to open up this screen and try to
make a match with your Kinstones and the one the other person has. The normal 
colors are red, blue and green; these, when making a match can do one of the 
following: Open up the vines in a tree or making an entrance somewhere (denoted
by a cave symbol in the map), opening paths (an arrow pointing up), creating 
golden enemies (Evil-looking egg in the map), making mini chests appears 
(scrolls on the map), making a giant plant grow to the clouds, filled with 
items (a plant symbol on the map) or creating a special NPC or making one need 
help (a person in the map). There are also golden Kinstones, but they are used 
for special situations.

Ok, once you have used the Kinstone you just got, you should see that a cave 
symbol appeared in the map of Link's house. Go there if you wish, there's a 
Heart Piece there. By the way, I won't really go around mentioning Kinfusions
in the guide, since they can be so random. Instead, I list all the Kinfusions
that you can do by the end of the game. And yes, you can get them all even
by that time.

So now we start with the next elemental. On town, go directly left from the 
entrance, inside the house with a chick on its roof. Talk to the teacher 
inside, his name is Swiftblade and he will teach you the Spin Attack (The 
usual, hold down the sword button to charge up and release). 
Go up to the square; see the puffs of dust piled up? Use the Jar to clear them 
up. For now, we are done in town. Head up the stairs and to the left. You 
should see a guard, first, talk to him then do a Spin Attack in front of him 
to make him let you go through.

Immediately in the next area head to the wooden stairs. Head down and blast 
down the wall to the right. Make sure you have 20 rupees and use your shield to
deflect the Deku Nut back to the Deku Scrub, then buy a bottle from him for 20
rupees. Go outside and up, then head left when you can (just before the bridge)
and then down between the rocks to go a screen to the left.

Welcome to Mount Crenel. Fill the bottle with water and use it on the seed 
in the hole to make it grow. Follow the path around and be careful of the 
white, spiny things, as they can hurt you (You can suck them in with the Jar 
though). Head right as you hit a fork and bomb the wall between the two fence 
pieces. 

Go inside and up the stairs. Bomb the stone block before going into mini and 
head to the green water pond. Fill up your bottle with this Crenel Hot Spring
Water. Now go back, grow up and head down and out to the fork. Take the 
left this time. If you ran out of bombs, take the left entrance and deflect
the attack of the Deku Scrub in order for it to sell you 10 bombs for 30 
rupees.

If you are good, them bomb the cracked wall you should have seen moments ago 
and go inside. Kill the Keeses and use the mushroom. Go up and head right to 
the exit. Once outside, jump into the mini-hurricane and you'll be floating for
a while with your hat as a parachute. Float to the left and into the other 
ledge. 

Here, go left and ignore the stairs for now as you keep heading up until you 
change screens. Bomb the space between the two trees to open a secret entrance.
Inside you can get a Heart Piece, 50 rupees from the right chest and a blue 
Kinstone. Now go back out and to the stairs we dissed a moment ago.

Go up and to the right. Use the Jar to suck in the spore-thingies here. You 
should find a stone suitable for going into mini. Before you use it, suck in 
the spores above you to uncover a hole in the ground for a Kinstone. Now go out
and use the stone to shrink. If you want another piece of a blue Kinstone, 
then head right once you are chibi and go up the vine and follow the only 
path there for a chest.

Otherwise, just go back to where you saw that green seed and enter the place. 
Yes, believe it or not, you can carry the seed as chibi (Use the R button when 
walking against it). Carry it out and place it on the hole in the ground then 
use that green water I told you to collect before, of course, once you have 
grown back to your normal size.

Once up, first head to the left and up the stairs, and bomb the wall between
the two rocks, just slightly right from the sign to get a Heart Piece and some
faeries.

Go back down and start heading right all the way until you see a bridge. Bomb 
the wall on the other side and go in. Get another blue Kinstone from the chest 
and head upstairs. 

Careful, the gray slimes turn into spike balls, and you can't hurt them at that
time. Simply kill them if you wish but bomb the blocks to get to the other 
side. Back outside, use the tornadoes again and head left. Then up the ladder.
Head right and bomb the wall for another Deku Scrub. You better have more than
40 rupees, 'cause you are gonna need 'em.

Buy the Grip Ring from it. With this, you can climb those walls now. Now head 
back left and down, then jump through the left ledge. Head west and you should 
see one of those walls. Being careful with the falling stones, start climbing 
it. 

First of all, head all the way right and bomb the fairly obvious entrance to 
reach a Great Fairy. Throw a bomb into the pond and choose the 3rd option 
(Neither) to upgrade your bomb bag to 30. Go out and head up. In the next 
screen head right for a mushroom. Use it.

After the rain starts and we get a better background music (In my opinnion 
anyway), use the stone to shrink yourself and head south to the mini passage. 
Careful of the droplets, they can hurt you while you make your way east. Once 
you are out, use the stone to go back to normal size and push the stone 
directly next to the hole. Then get the stone on the far right to fit in the 
hole directly right from the first shrinking stone. And head down the ladder.

Head down being careful from surprise rushes from those things. Then push the 
upper block.

In this puzzle of sorts, push the block on the south and then push the block 
that's slightly above and to the left so you can push the one that was 
previously adjacent to it to the north. Before we go further, push the block 
directly south from there. Go around and push the lower one of the two blocks 
together, then the leftmost of the line of blocks. Then the one on top of them,
move the one directly below you and then the final one to go through (Did any 
of that made sense?).

Make your way right and enter the next door. Now, before you think of the 
mushroom, stand directly north of it and use the Jar to suck in the vase so 
it'll be out of the way, then rocket yourself to the other side with the 
mushroom, go up.

Go for the vases if you need bombs. Then go south and stand in the piece of the
bridge there, place down a bomb and use R to pick it up, then throw it to the 
other side so it'll hit the switch. Almost there...

In the next cavern you can enter, move the rock around to fit in the hole; then
go down. At the bottom, where there are two blocks together, push the bottom 
one to the left and the upper one out of the way. Then simply move the upper 
one of the next set to get yet another blue Kinstone. Head out and we are 
there. Go chibi and enter the mini passage you can see to reach the Mountain 
town of Melari (Melari's Mines).

Yattoko~ Yattoko~

Just keep heading down in a clockwise fashion until you reach the furnace in 
the middle. And talk to the giant Picoru there. 

Yes, he is Melari and he'll fix you your Broken Picori Blade. But while they
are working, your hat suggests you go looking for the next element. So head 
up and talk to the Picori blocking the exit. You will be able to go through. 

Grow back to normal size and activate the Wing Crest, then go up to reach 
the 2nd dungeon: the Cave of Flames. 

Once inside, head right and hit the bombs but be careful. They go totally nuts
when hit and start running around. If you hit one a second time, its legs will
go off and you can carry it, but be warned they have a short fuse. Bomb the 
wall you see there. In the next room, use your shield to flip around the 
enemies, then whack 'em crazy with your sword. Grab the Compass once you are 
done and head left.

Careful with the rupees. The lower, middle one is actually a green Like-Like, 
and they got some endurance. Anyway, head down the stairs. Keep heading left 
and up the steps. Then follow the railroad track, go down and right at the 
fork. 
Board the mine cart and watch. In the next room keep going left and bomb the 
wall at the end, either with bomb enemies, or with yours. Kill all the enemies 
here to make a shrink stone appear.

Go chibi and use the upper, mini exit. Head right all the way through the mini 
holes and south when you can to change screens. Go left in order to jump down 
and use the shrink stone to grow up. You can clear the fire with a quick swipe 
of your sword by the way. Go up and grab the chest for the Dungeon Map.

Start heading south, but beware of the rocks in the lava. They will collapse 
when you stand on them, so move quickly. Go to the chest for a blue Kinstone 
and press the switch. Then make your way to the door. Use the moving tile to 
get through and don't kill the worms by sending them to the lava. Instead, use 
them as stepping stones to fill the holes. The chest there contains 50 rupees. 
Go up the stairs and don't fill that hole. Go right and down and use the 
tornado there, and the other to go around. Then move the block out of the way 
and push the chest atop the mini pillar into the hole so you can get the chest 
for a Small Key. Oh yeah, press the switch and go through.

Head left and board the mine cart again then open the door there and hit the 
switch. Ride the cart again. Go left and head up the room I told you to avoid 
as chibi. Walk on the track to head right, then bomb the southern wall to get
a Heart Piece and go back up twice.

Jump down the ledge and destroy all the spike slimes. With this you'll get 
the Patch Cane, or as I prefer, the Golden Rod, but the official name is the
Cane of Pacci so.... With this, you can hurl shiny, yellow balls in a 
straight line. If they hit certain objects, they'll flip around (like the 
cart we saw just before), if used on a hole in the ground, they'll fill it 
and if you drop in and jump out, you'll jump higher. Nifty thing indeed. 

In the next room, see that tile with spikes? Step on the first one and use the 
Cane of Pacci to flip it around and move quickly. Then use it to fill the hole
and jump upwards. Go down and turn the cart around. Push the chest atop the 
pillar into the hole for another Small Key. Ride the cart back and head north,
jump down and unlock the door there. 

Ignore the switch for now and go chibi. Make your way left avoiding the green 
spike balls. And go all the way to the other shrink stone. You saw those red 
things right? Well, now they will pursue you as you make your way back. Once 
you are done, use the Cane to flip the cart and ride it. Then hit the 
switch, and ride it again.

Use the grubs there to fill in the four holes at the bottom, the pull the 
switch on the pillar to the top hole and hit it. Go up the steps and to the 
next screen. 

Jump down the northern ledge to get a blue Kinstone, then push the block out of
the way, then use the Cane to fill in the hole below the chest to get a 
green Kinstone. Take the right exit. Use the Cane on the moving tile to 
flip it around and take it so you head north to hit a switch that'll make the 
red portal appear. Then go back to the entrance and board the tile to the south
and do the same with the next 2 you see. Before you board the next tile, flip 
around the top vases. Then make your way to the upper exit.

Go up the steps and jump down the ledge and head right. Go to the chest on the 
far side for a green Kinstone. Then head back, fill up the upper hole and jump 
to the other side. Use the tornado to go to the northern ledge and follow the 
path. Use this next tornado to go slightly to the left as you head south to 
reach another ledge.

Use the tornado and head south. Use this next one to reach the small place 
filled with fire. Clear them and use the Patch Cane to jump up and use the 
tornadoes to the left to reach a chest with a green Kinstone. Use the next set 
of tornadoes to reach the Boss Key. You have the door just north of you, so go 
on.

Fill up with life if you need and equip the Cane and Sword.

Welcome to Gleerok's lair.
This boss is fairly easy, just try to make a shot from the Patch Cane hit its 
back so the shell will flip around and harm him. It will then lower its neck to
the ground. Use this time to go up it and attack like a madman at the romboid 
thingy on its back. After each attack session this thing will spit loads of 
fire, which you can clear with your sword... Nonetheless, it's annoying... 
Repeat this process until you get this guy down.

You'll get the Fire Element and another Heart. Take the portal to head out 
and go back to the Mines, back to the blacksmith to get the White 
Sword. Melari then explains about infusing your sword with the power of the
elements and all that. So hear the Picori say Yattoko~ One more time before 
you leave to Hyrule Castle.

Once you are in keep heading straight north to the next room and take the right
path to find the stairs going down. Head south and left when you can to take 
the exit you should see to the backyard. Go north and enter the Elemental
Sanctuary. Go to the next room, stand in front of the pedestal and user your
sword to charge it up.

Time to do some cloning! Simply stand in one of those glowing tiles and charge 
your sword to the max, a small orb will appear in the panel and then you have 
to move to the other panel without letting go of the sword button. This will 
create a clone of you. In short, if this clone were to collide against a solid 
object, it'll disappear. Pressing the R button, taking damage, or special 
attacks and destroy your clones too, but right now you can only make one.

Head down and use the cloning technique so you can your clone hit both switches
at the same time to go out. Once you are back at the Castle Fields... Mini boss
time. Simply hit these things from the back. Once you are done, you'll will see
how Gufuu became what he is, and about Ezero, your hat. Go back to town and 
with the trainer to learn a new technique, which is in fact the ability to 
break pots with your sword.

Feel free to do some other stuff, like going all the way right with the cuckoo 
girl and get some cash. Ok, things get weird now... Remember the place where 
you got the first bottle? Go there again but instead, use the cloning technique
to push the 2x2 block there. Go up the ladder and bomb the wall for a red 
Kinstone. Head south and go inside the tree there, and speak to the person 
there if you wish, but head east and down a screen for more events.

I suggest you head down to push the rock to the right so you fill the hole. 
Then go back up and push the other rock right above the stairs to fill another
hole. There's a fairy pond between the two rocks, if you wish to bomb it open.
Go back down again and head left all the way and up to reach the Castor Wilds.
After Ezlo speaks, go back to Hyrule Town and go inside the shoe shop (The 
upper left one in the middle square). The person there should fall asleep. 
Shrink yourself and go up the desk to speak to the Picori there.

They want you to go speak with Syrup, and they'll place a checkmark on your 
map. Go to the LonLon Ranch and shrink yourself in the stump above the house 
and make your way in. Go back to your normal size and break the vases for the 
key. Shrink yourself and go out, then to normal size and speak to Talon. 
They'll open the house and you can now go through. Go slightly north and the 
left to go inside a cavern. Use the cloning technique to get a chest with 50 
rupees.

For now, head right and you should see a tornado. Take the upper path and 
follow it to a hole. First, push the rock you can see to fill one up. If you 
want a Heart Piece, head left and up to another hole, fill it with the Cane and
jump up. In the next screen, head to the right going down the stairs and go 
right for it. Once you are done, head back to the previous screen.

Using the Cane to fill up the hole to your right, jump up and shrink yourself, 
then head right and enter the hole in the ground for a red Kinstone. Go back to
your size and use the tornado to reach the ledge directly to your south. Go 
right and use this other tornado to go south all the way, passing a small water
patch. Head right to Lake Hylia. Just head south and then left to go back to 
Chiroria's Forest. Head down and up the stairs, follow the path and enter the
house. Buy the mushroom for 60 rupees and head back to the Hylia's Lake screen.
Take the left path here so you can push another rock into its place. Then go 
back to the shoe shop... Oh, if you have the money (80), I suggest you get the
upgraded rupee bag at the shop. This can hold up to 300. 

Oh yeah, go all the way north of town and to the right to one of those stone 
wings. Activate it.

Now, in the shoe shop, simply press A or R in front of the guy to wake him up. 
You'll get the Pegasus Boots out of this. With these, you can dash into trees 
(some) to make the leaves sprawl out so you can use the stumps to shrink 
yourself. Be sure to go back with Swiftblade the trainer to learn your third
Tiger Skill.

So, remember the Castor Wilds? Let's go back there.
_______________________________________________________________________________
[033]-------------------------03.03. Wind Ocarina------------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Here, if you try to walk on the swamp you'll simply sink. Use the Boots to dash
instead. Go left from where you begin and go up the vine you see there. Take 
the upper left bridge and once you reach the next stop, go down the vine and 
into the opening there. Simply follow the path and once you see the chest, 
well... It'll go *poof* leaving you instead with an armed knight. These guys 
block your attacks, so you gotta catch him offguard, like when he attacks. Hit 
him enough times to make him go *poof* instead and give you back the chest for 
a golden Kinstone. Golden Kinstones are special, they are the only Kinstones 
used for story purposes.

Head back out. Go up the vine there and take the upper right bridge. Head down 
that vine and go left to another swamp which you should cross using the boots. 
The spiny vines won't hurt you if you mad dash into them. You should see a 
shrink stump; use it and enter the small passage on the left and on the 
water... Use the Jar to navigate the lillypad. Once on the other side, go down 
the hole and start slashing like crazy to kill all those blue beetles. You'll 
get the Bow from this. Go back and return to normal size. 

Once you are on the other side of this swamp, you see that statue with one eye?
Shoot at it with the bow and then hit it again 3 times when it attacks you. Go
up and use the tornado to head down and left, in an attempt to clear the water
patch there. Then head down to another swamp. Keep heading down and left and 
you should find another of those wing stones. Destroy the eye guardian there 
too. Before you go up the vines, go left and push the rock you see there to 
fill a hole. 

Now go up and take this bridge to a tornado, which you should ride all the way 
down and left, clearing the water. Push the rock and enter the cave for another
golden Kinstone. Now, for the last Kinstone, go left from the cave and up, 
through where we pushed one rock a few moments ago. Head north and up a vine, 
take the upper bridge, then the next and the next. Head down here to find 
another eye guardian. Destroy it and head up and left to another cave, here's 
the last one. Now go back and south to push another stone. Ok, now look at your
map at the lower left corner. You see those three heads? Well, we should head 
there, but instead, go back to where the last eye guardian was and take two 
bridges back. In this platform, take the other bridge to reach yet another eye
guardian, kill it to reach a blue Kinstone; oh, and the rupees that appear here
are actually red Like-Likes. Now you can go to the giant heads. 

Each giant head asks for a certain golden Kinstone, in total 3, which we just 
got. Just press L in front of each head and find the matching Kinstone for the 
one it has.

Welcome to the Wind Ruins.
So yeah, go up and bomb the wall for a blue Kinstone. Then head south. 
See that statue there? It'll go alive when you touch it, at which time you have
to kill it. Do so and proceed.

Use the stump to shrink and go inside the hole to get a red Kinstone. Then go 
the guardian, still in small size and go up the mini ladder in its shield to go
inside and hit the switch. Return to your size and kill it. Go around and push 
the stone. In the next room just go if you wish, but kill all the enemies in 
the next to open the path. Keep going until you see another stump. Use it and 
do the same to the guardian, go inside and flip the switch so you can destroy 
it. Push the stone when you can and keep going.

In the next room you can only kill three guardians, the other will flee and 
block your path. Kill the ones you can for now and grab the chests for 50 
seashells and 50 rupees. Now use the stump to shrink and go inside the last 
guardian and flip the switch to turn it off. This way it won't block your path 
anymore. Kill all the snakes here and also the weird enemies that hide under 
the rocks so you can go through.

Welcome to the Fortress of Winds. First, head left and into the door you can 
see. Head up the stairs and go around above to the next screen. Shot the eye 
with an arrow. In the next room you'll be attacked by 4 Stalfos; deal with them
and head south. One of the green rupees is a Like-Like, so kill it and head 
right to deal with a red Like-Like, then go up the ladder. Follow the only path
to the next room. Here, shoot the 2 eyes in front of you while moving on the 
platform to open this door to a room with two sleeping eye guardians and two 
switches.

Use the cloning technique to hit both switches and deal with the guardians to 
get the Compass. Head right and hit both eyes to open that door. Kill the 
snakes and make a clone of you so that you are a vertical line and push the 
block all the way right, then the one below all the way left. Cancel the clone 
and now make a horizontal line so you can push the right block up. Pull the 
lever to make a key fall and follow it. Back to the very first room, ignore 
the central door and take the first one to your right.

Go up and being careful of the sparkling, thingy enemy pull the right lever for
a chest with a blue Kinstone. Then open the left chest for another blue 
Kinstone. Pull the lever there to open the door. Simply head up the ladder here
and into the next room. Go left and kill the guardian that is active. Then use 
that panel to make a clone and the one by the right wall. Move to hit the two 
switches we just saw and go in to shrink yourself. Go back, flip the guardian 
on (How wrong did that sound?) and use the shrink stone there. Kill the 
guardian afterwards and pull the lever to see another key fly by. Before you
drop down, go to mini Link and then drop, take the mini path there to get a 
Heart Piece. Leave the room and go back for the Small Key.

Now you can take the central door. Do so and go up the stairs, kill the Stalfos
and the eye guardians and grab the chest for the Dungeon Map. Go up and open 
the left door first. (If you took the right one first, then simply go through.
You should see a room with 4 switches; use the statues and the clone panels
to press them all and get another key. Head down and all the way left to
be back in the room with the two doors.)

Use the platform to get to the other side and hit the eye in the next room 
ASAP. You can find that loved, hand enemy here that'll drag your behind out 
of the dungeon if it gets you. Go to the next room for another of those armed 
knights. Dispose of it to get the blue portal.

In the next room, avoid the spike balls and hit the switch to go through the 
door. In the room to the right, you see those three floor panels with a design 
on them? Bomb the middle one to get the Mole Mitts.

With them, you can dig through the sand thingies you see there, as well as 
digging on ground in the world map. Get 100 rupees from the chest there. Head 
out and right to reach the room with the two locked doors.

For now, some backtracking. In this room, go straight south and use the claws 
to dig the statue free so you can push it onto the switch for a chest with 
another blue Kinstone. Leave this room and take the stairs down to where we 
started. If you go all the way to the right, you can find another 100 rupee. If
you go back to the first room right of the main one and go up until you find 
the dig-able walls you can get a red Kinstone. Going up will net you another 
red Kinstone. Go up again and drop through the floor hole while you are in mini
Link to use the hole there to get to a Heart Piece. To get out, push downwards 
the 2nd block from left to right.

Now go out and left all the way to reach a chest with a blue Kinstone. Enter 
the door closest to you and kill the wind wizards to get 80 seashells. Go out 
and to the door right next to it. Go up and into the first room with dig-able 
walls. In the right corner, near where you start is a chest with a red 
Kinstone. Once you've grabbed it, head up and press the switch after going 
through the walls for a chest with, surprise, a red Kinstone. Go back now to 
the room with the two locked doors.

Open the right door and equip the Pegasus Boots. Pull the ledge and dash 
through the bridge. Head right and kill the hands to make a shrink stone 
appear. Pay no attention to it for now and instead head right. In this room 
head around it to reach the cloning panels. First though, push/pull a statue
onto the upper left switch and the lower right one. That way you can make a 
clone in the opposite way; one on the upper right and you on the lower left. 
Grab the key that falls and open the door.

Go back a room and use the shrink stone. Go back and move between the rolling 
spikes to go south, then head west. You see the entrance there? Go in and 
return to your size before pressingthe switch. Now dig through the walls to 
reach the key. Head down the ledge, return to your size and lay the smackdown
on the hands. 

Then head right and down the door. Dig through and go up the ladder. Use the 
key here and drop through the RIGHT hole. Open the chest for the Boss Key. Push
the block to the left and go back to the room that had the two locked doors and
head south.

Remember that room with a statue, a switch that created a chest with a Kinstone
and a ladder that I didn't even mention? Go up there, dig through and push the
upper right block to your right to trigger the red warp. Open the Boss' chamber
and prepare.

The whole boss isn't that difficult, but might catch you offguard. 
Simply use the bow to shoot at the eye that's not attacking you to stun the 
hand, then whack it like a mad maniac. Once you get both hands out of the 
business, the whole thing will go into sleep mode. Shrink yourself and go 
inside the boss and hit the flashing pillar like crazy. 3 times should suffice,
but after the first one, the pillar chamber will be filled with sand and you 
gotta dig through, not to mention you can't see which pillar to attack until 
you are right next to it (Because of the flashing...).  

No element this time, so grab your heart piece and go up. Check the giant 
tablet and obtain the Ocarina... of Time! Ok, bad joke... Just a plain Ocarina 
this time. It's actually the Wind Ocarina. You'll be warped outside the 
dungeon. Use the Ocarina to head back to town.

Ok, but lets get something else right now. Go to the LonLon Ranch and head 
south a screen and down the stairs. Go right, and using the Cane of Pacci, jump
with the hole to the ledge above. Go right and enter the groove to find a 
Great Fairy, which will raise you wallet to a max of 500; just select the 
first option twice. 

Ok, now we are done with that. At this time, Tingles, 4 to be precise have 
appeared all around Hyrule. One is to the right of Link's house, another one by
the Lake Hylia spot you can get to with the Ocarina, in the screen right before
the swamp, go north and through the underground passage to find another, and 
the last one is in the LonLon Ranch, just take the underground entrance in 
their lawn to get to it. Complete their Kinstone swaps if you want the Magical
Boomerang. If you need green Kinstones, simply cut the grass/bushes and repeat
until you get the one you need.

Ok, so for the boomerang go to each place they opened up and light each torch.
You can also find the following: 200 seashells and 3 red Kinstones. Once all 4
torches are lit, you can access the central chamber from the outside. I just
saved you from wasting 300 rupees in the normal Boomerang.
_______________________________________________________________________________
[034]---------------------03.04. Water Drop Elemental--------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Ok, back to the general walkthrough. Go back to the Lake Hylia spot with the 
Ocarina, shrink yourself and go inside the Picori house and talk to the Picori.
Now, go back to Hyrule's Town and to the building to your left, the one 
previously guarded by an old man. The libary is now open. Go in and talk to 
everyone, also, check the bulletin board in the back. Then go up and outside, 
turn the vase over with the Cane and shrink yourself. Go back in and to the 
bookcase. Go out and back to your normal size.

This part was hell in the first run. Go near the cuckoo girl house, but first, 
load up some water in your bottle. If you go above the cuckoo girl, you should 
see two houses with a small wooden path above them, right? Enter the left one 
and put out the fire. Then turn around the vase there and shrink yourself. Go 
up the chimney you just put out and into the house next to it. Go around 
inside avoiding the cat (It will pounce on you) and go up the mini stairs to 
the bookcase, push the book from above and go back. When you are in normal 
size, come and retrieve the book from the floor.

Ok, go to the cafe and use the jug there to shrink yourself. Exit using the 
south-western exit and go left to a small bridge. Head up until you see a dog, 
talk to it while shrunk and it will finally move away. Now enter the house 
right next to you and go into the only other exit you can take which will take
you to a Picori home. Talk to to it and leave the house entirely, then head 
slightly south. You see that flower path? Take it to enter the carpenter's 
house. Use the jug there to grow back. Go back to the libary and talk to the 
female librarian on the left twice. The first time you'll give her the book you
just got and the next is a small briefing. So go now to the house next to the 
dog and try to open it. You should be able to now, put out the fire inside it 
with a water bottle and go back to the carpenter's house to shrink yourself.

Go back to the house we came from and go inside the small hole on the right and
talk to the Picori there. Then go up and out the chimney. Go north and enter 
the yellow house, then take the exit on the other side. Follow the water side
and go into a small flower patch with two cats. Avoid them like the plague and
head down to the fountain, enter the mini cave there. Once inside, head right
and use the Patch Cane on the hole to jump up. Kill the 4 blue beetles to get
the Power Bracelets. With these, you can move objects as mini link. Nifty. Now,
leave this place and go back to the house of the guy that's just reading, the
one whose chimney we just used. Push the first drawer (the left one) to the 
left and do the same with the right one so you can reach the higher exit. Now,
clear the dust with the Jar and on the left side you should see cloning panels.
Make a vertical line and maneuver yourself to the falling book on the right 
side. Stand with the Picori to make it drop. Once done, pick the book when you
are of normal size.

Ok, remember the witch we bought the mushroom from? Go to her house, but if you
see carefully, there is a sand entrance right next to the stairs leading to the
witch's house. Go in using the digging gloves and head up the ladder on the 
other side. Go right once outside and up past the house to the tree. Bump it 
with the Pegasus Boots to uncover a stump and shrink yourself. Use the small 
stone path you can see and then once in the mini passage, use the lillypad and 
the Jar to go south and enter the house. Use the mini lillypad to cross over, 
then move the shelf to the right so you can climb and drop the book. Go back 
out and careful of the flies, return to your size to pick up the book. Now go 
back to the library and hand them in.

Now go up, outside, shrink yourself and go to the bookshelf. Take the first 
blue book up and follow the path, at the end talk to the old Picori and be 
dropped... Push the lower left blocks to leave this cage of sorts and head 
down. Using the Jar, pull in the mushroom and head left. Then head up to fight
a pair of ants. You can either hit them in the back, or whack 'em when they 
throw their pincers at you. This will net you the Flippers. Basic controls, A 
to swim faster, B to hide under the water or to simply dive.

Jump into the water and head south at the crossroads to exit this place. Use 
the Library's Jug to return to your size. Now, warp yourself to the Lake Hylia
spot and go north from where you begin. Jump into the water near where the 
Tingle is and keep heading south, as if you were going to the house that we got
the 3rd book from. You should have seen that Heart Piece, right? Well, get it 
and head left and up the stairs there to enter the house inside the tree for 
another Heart Piece. We can't learn a technique here yet. But go left from here
and push the rock into the hole, then go back and jump into the water. Head 
slightly north and west to the ice floor. Jump on it and shrink in through.

The fourth dungeon at last, also known as the Temple of Droplets. You should
have seen the name I got for this dungeon back in the Jp version...

So you go down and head up, move the ice out of the way and take the upper 
exit. Head right and down the stairs. Turn the switch down there and head up 
then drop through the hole.

Now, move the frozen key to the light to melt it. Go back up and left to use it
and with no other choice, fall down. Head right and what? Is that the Boss Key?
Yes... 

Ok, push the ice block further down all the way down and then left, then push 
the one on top to the left and do the same for the Key one. Push the one with 
the key up and then left again, then down, left, up and finally right. Now turn
the switch around to close the floor above.

No, if you though we would face the boss so soon, well, you think they will let
us do it so easily? Head down and left then all the way south for the Dungeon 
Map. Go back north and go in for a swim to the west. Go up the stairs and 
head east, following the only path until you see a mushroom in which, as usual,
you'll use the Jar to go over. Press the switch and drop through the waterfall.

Start heading south and press the switch you see there and go right. You see 
that structure in the water? Go to the middle and dive with the B button for a 
Small Key. Then go back and up the wall besides the waterfall. We passed a 
locked door on the way down, so go there, hit the switch on the other side and 
board the lillypad. Steer it all the way down the waterfall. Then move it right
to the switch we couldn't hit earlier. Head right for another worm enemy, the 
big ones. Once it's down, head up through the newly opened door to get the 
Compass.

Board the lillypad and head to the previous room then up. Steer the lillypad to
the first ice chunk and press the switch. From there, head directly to the ice 
chunk right above you so you'll be in the main piece. Head left and down to see
loads of ice cubes and a switch. At the very top, you should see that there are
two in vertical alingment. Push the one on top down, right, down, left and up 
to land on the switch. But before we go back, head north for a chest with 50 
rupees.

Go back to your ride and steer it all the way around so you can reach the door 
on the upper-right corner of the room. Can't see anything huh? Just stick to 
the wall as you go north-east. In the next room simply take the staircase up to
fight 3 ants and get the blue portal. Head down and left to see a giant switch.
Go down and make a clone, then go for the switch.

Proceed to the place melted up and follow the only path, getting a blue 
Kinstone in the way. Maneuver through the ice carefully and get the chest for
a blue Kinstone if you wish. Then go  down and time yourself with the green 
spike balls. You want to head left at this point to move on, as there are only 
2 vases on the right side. Go up in the next room since you can't do anything 
about the ice cubes yet.

Head down the stairs, twice and flip the switch. Then go up and flip the switch
there which you couldn't access previously. Go down again and flip the switch 
once again to reach the friggin Key. Go back to the room with the ice cubes and
unlock the door there. Flip the switch there and prepare to fight a cheap copy 
of the first boss, except that this guy is electrified and while the energy is 
on, you can't suck its base off. So wait for the energy to wear off and suck 
with the Jar. Then hack at it.

When the thing finally explodes into nothingness, open the chest for the 
Flame Lantern... Or just Lantern, heck... So head back up and burn the ice 
cubes there. Simply press the button the Lantern is equiped to to light it up 
and you can walk around with it. Head down the stairs and get 100 rupees from
the chest and head right. Fight 3 more ants. If you want, you can lit the 
torches, but they won't be of use. 

Head right again. First, take the lower path to hit a torch, light it up to 
open another path. Take the newly opened path and at the fork head left for 
a red Kinstone, then go right to lit another torch. Head north from there and 
go left at the first fork, and keep going left. Bomb the wall there to reach 
a room full of beetles. Kill them all to get a key. Go back to the previous 
room and immediately head up then right at the fork for another red Kinstone 
and another torch you should lit. Back to the fork head left and down through 
the second line when you can to reach yet another red Kinstone and the last 
torch.

Just head left in this next room. Carefully make your way to the upper right 
door and go below the structure and to the left side. First, make a vertical 
clone and push the block at the top all the way left. Then, with a horizontal 
clone push the one above you all the way down. Push the next one only one 
square down and finally, with another vertical clone, push back the first block
you pushed.

In this next room, first of all, push the ice cube to the left. Then head left 
and push the cube there down and to the left. Now, either place yourself at the
northernmost panel of either set and make a clone in the northernmost panel of 
the other set and make your way carefully to the other side to press the 
switches. Then head down.

Here simply push the upper right block one space up. Melt the ice cube in the 
next room and make a vertical clone so you can push the block partially hidden 
by the ice bridge and go up the stairs to the next room where you have to lit 
all 9 torches and they can unlit as time passes, so make haste. Make your way 
down in the next room and then go right. Careful with these flies as you press 
the switch for the red portal and bomb the wall.

Inside another dark room, use the Lantern to not only give you light, but to 
burn the spiderweb and dispose of the two giant worms. Go right once you are 
done and follow this path to the other giant switch. Again, make a clone and 
flip the switch to free the element! Which will be taken by a bigass Octorok...

This boss ain't so hard. First, equip your shield and sword and deflect the 
giant rocks it shoots at you. After three it will go crazy and freeze the whole
place. Now, lit the Lantern and try to touch its tail. Once you are done with 
that, take cover. It will start trashing around and make stone slabs fall 
everywhere. Repeat this process about 2 more times to be done with this thing.
He might also use black ink to turn everything dark, in which case, simply lit
up the Lantern.

Finally, when it's down, get the Water Elementl and your Heart. Use the 
green portal to go to the entrance, then stand in the ray of light and press R.
So we have our new destination.

[035]-------------------------03.05. Wind Element------------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Begin by heading back to town. In the square town, enter the middle shop on the
left and speak to the person there. Basically, you pay him 10 Rupees and then 
you dream of a lot of enemies and if you kill them all, you get a Heart Piece. 
Head to the cafe and shrink yourself, the move the shelf to the left so you can
climb up and head to the left in the attic.

Inside the attic of the shop, there is a chest with 10 seashells. Head up from 
there to enter the shop itself and grow big there. Check the bottle and get a 
request. Use the Ocarina to head to Lake Hylia and go into the house above of 
where you start and press R when facing the bowl. Go out and dive into the 
small pond next to it to get a Heart Piece by the way.

Before we proceed further, head to the left part of town and right below the
Post Office, in the yellow house. Fuse with the person inside to make a weird
warp show in in the Southern Hyrule Fields. Go there and to the 2nd floor of
the house and using the Jar, suck in that ghost circling around the old man.
Just hold down the Jar button and move around so it doesn't escapes the suction
area.

Head back to town. Head up the Castle Fields and go left right away. Jump to 
the water and surface on the other side. Head up the steps and using the Pacci 
Cane, bounce up and hit the switch to extend the bridge. Now head north to the
middle of the four trees and left from there. Head down the stairs, twice to 
get another Heart Piece then go back up and to the castle.

Head left immediately and you should see the guards patroling. Avoid them like
the plague, or like you did in OoT if you played it and head to the other side.
Clear the bush field and go down the stairs. Follow the path and press the 
switch. Then simply go up from there and back into the sanctuary. Power up 
your sword once more and go back to where we got that last Heart Piece. Oh 
yeah, now you can make up to two clones. 

Head outside the castle and go south a screen. As you begin here, make your
way left. You should see a wodden stair going into the gound, take it.

Use the panels you see there to clone and to move that 3x3 block out 
of the way so you'll end up on the other side. Head up and left to reach the...
Valley of the King's House? Wtf... I really need to resume my Japanese... Or 
perhaps its Valley of the Kings Tomb... 

Ok, head down and careful of the ghosts. They are really bothersome. And the 
crows will send your money flying away. Follow the only path and you'll hit the
Lost Woods. People have said the route changes, but in my case, it was north, 
west, west, north, east and north, and this happened twice (In my first game 
and on this one). Just try to follow the signs. In the next place head north 
and follow the path; taking north at the fork to the house of Dampe, whom'll 
give you the key to the graveyard...

But oh boy, the crime rates are high if a crow just swiped the key away from 
you. This is fairly easy, simply find the tree that the crow is on and ram it 
with the Pegasus Boots. Then go back to Dampe. In the graveyard, go to the 
upper left and push the tombstone to enter a room with a Heart Piece and a 3x3 
block, just make clones to push it out of the way. Now go back out and all the
way right and down to the stones. Break them to uncover cloning panels. Make
the clones and carefully move to the switches. Then go inside this tomb.

Kill the mummies and get the key, then use the left mushroom to rocket 
yourself. Only the middle door is real. Head right and make the two clones 
on the two vertical, adjacent panels and move up to hit the switches for a key.
In the left side do the same with the vertical panels and use the floating ones
to move for another key. Use both keys in the middle locks and keep going 
through. Eventually you'll reach a trap room, simply light up the candles and
fight two more mummies then head north for some more story and a golden 
Kinstone.

Head back to town and go to the castle fields, taking the upper right exit. 

If you haven't been here before, welcome to the Veil Falls.
From there, dive into the water for the Heart Piece you clearly saw and then
go back up, taking the stone bridge to a stone where you have to use the 
Kinstone we just got. Make use of the Lantern and follow the only path but bomb
the wall between the two rocks at the upper floor to get 50 seashells and 
further above, after moving the 3x3 block, 100 seashells. Go back down and take
the exit we ignored.

Once out head up the climbing wall and activate the wing stone there. Then head
north inside a cave. Bomb the fairly obvious wall to your right for 50 
seashells. Then head up the stairs in the previous room to get 100 rupees and 
exit this place through the right exit. Climb up some more and go into the 
giant tornado. Ok, this place involves a lot of warping and 5 golden Kinstones.
First, head right and take the red tornado. Once up, you get the first golden 
Kinstone. Drop down through the hole there and head north to another tornado.
Head north while digging through the clouds and jump down. Use the Kinstone we
just got here.

Then go back up and with the normal tornadoes head left and drop off there. You
can kill these fishes with your bow, but they are rather troublesome. Kill them
however to get another golden Kinstone and head back up. Dig to your left and 
use the tornado and the next one to head up and left to a chest with another 
golden Kinstone. Above them you can also find 50 seashells in two chests, for a
total of 100 partially hidden in the clouds. Use the tornado to head to the 
cloud mass below the one we just were on. Drop off here.

To beat the Lakitu thingy, use the Patch Cane to flip it off and then hack at 
it. Fuse a pair of Kinstones here and go back up. Start taking the tornadoes 
down and left to another cloud mass with a chest surrounded by clouds with 50 
seashells (Growing tired of these things?). Drop off the hole here and go right
for another Lakitu-type enemy. Fuse this Kinstone as well. Take this tornado 
and open the chest for the 4th golden Kinstone. Go back down a floor and head 
south to take the right red tornado up and drop off to the right. Kill the two
fishes here to reveal the last golden Kinstone then take the red tornado 
closest to the Kinstone.

Grab this chest for 50 seashells and use the tornado to head directly below and
slightly right. You see that small space in the cloud formation that you can 
dig through? Head there to fall off and take the red tornado you can see there,
then drop off slightly to the north to fuse another Kinstone. Head north and 
west with the tornadoes and dig through. You are back near where you began, 
simple take the tornado there and start heading east and south when you can to
reach the very first stop. Yes, the first Kinstone you saw is the last one to 
fuse. Follow the two guys up the tornado and activate the wing stone there.

Enter the house and in the above room you can get two green Kinstones. So head
up a floor and in the alcove you can get another green Kinstone. I hope you
listened to me when I told you to fuse with a strange guy in town and aid the
guy being haunted by a ghost... If you did, you'll get the Light Arrow. If
you didn't, I believe there's no other way to recover this.

Go up another floor for not one, but two blue Kinstones AND one red Kinstone, 
woo~ Another floor up... Grab the two red Kinstones and speak to the 
elder-looking person then go back and speak to the kid blocking the staircase. 
This is the entrance to the 5th dungeon. Ready?

Welcome to the Palace of Winds~ 
Follow the only path and hit the switches as you have to in order to cross the 
bridges and for your sake, you better have the Magic Boomerang, otherwise, get 
out of here and get it, trust me... Once you see the clone panels, make two 
clones after you extend the bridge and push the block up then go on.

Use the floating panels to go through and land on the other side to go left. 
Head up the stairs and go left in the wiring. Go down the stairs and after 
Ezero speaks to you, head down to hit the switch to go down, hit it again to 
move further left and then try to hit while you are OUT of the bridge but on 
the left side. Yes, you need the magic boomerang or a bomb. Go up and kill 
the various waves of wind wizards to get the Roc's Cape! (I love this thing!) 
Press the button you assign it to jump, pressing it again will make Link glide
over and the longer you press it, the further it glides. So jump/glide to the 
right and before you go into the clouds, head right.

Go all the way up into a small square that seems cut off from the wiring, jump
on it to go down and open the chest for a red Kinstone, then jump back and go 
to the clouds. Simply press B and hold it to automatically do the second 
jump/glide so you can go up faster. Head right here with a jump/glide twice. In
the next room simply play with the blocks so you get to the panels and make 
your clones in the southernmost line (yourself included) then charge up your 
sword and go down. Release the spin to hit all four switches and kill the 
enemies that appear. 

Be careful in here, the wind can, and will blow you away if it gets you. Head 
north and then jump to the other side and south there. Once you are down all 
the way south, equip the Cane and try to launch a ball into the hole when
the wind is gone, then bounce up. Proceed left and jump down in the wired 
square. You guessed it, the red rupee is a Like-Like. Jump up and time the jump
on the left with the floating panels, then jump up the other side and do the
same for the cloud stairs. 

Here you need to time yourself with the platform so you release the clones not 
long before the platform gets to you so you can still board without losing much
energy. Then head down and push the block. In the next room, drop the panel in 
the middle of the floor with designs and jump to the platform. Careful with the
crows, you have to jump between platforms several times. Then it's just 
standard jumping in the next screen as you head right.

Drop down and go north, then use the Cane to fill in the rightmost hole to 
bounce up. Make your clones on the other side, using each corned adjacent to a 
switch to him them all. Use the shrink stone and head south. Push the vases out
of the way as you make your way left then north and in the next screen head 
north as well to grow back to normal. Hit the switch, grab the key and head to
the rolling spikes to unlock the door there and go up the clouds.

Head left and be careful of the breezes as you walk through the bridge. Right 
now, you can only head down when you hit the blocks, do so and head right 
avoiding the traps and the slimes, then use the air to propel you in mid jump 
all the way to the other side and go north. Careful of the Lakitus, use the 
Cane to flip them out of business as you head north.

Jump up the clouds and then jump to the right as you yell "Geronimo!" Head up 
the stairs and right for a blue Kinstone then go back, jump right and do the 
same "Geronimo!" routine if you wish. But go to the floor above when you are 
ready and down a door.

These things will only attack you when you are in a straight line of them. So 
let them see you and as they attack, pounce at them like those cats in Hyrule 
did to you when you were small! This will make a key fall, which you will use 
right away. Here keep going left until you see the clone panels. You can either
use 4 vases, or just place one and clone yourself to stand on the other 
switches. But head left nonetheless and hit the switch to start the fan. Use it
to head down and kill the enemies that will trap you. Then head right twice and
repeat the fan routine but northwards this time. Push the block directly below 
the chest for a key, which you'll use right away and get the Boss Key. Head 
back down and right to the room with the boss door. 

Oh, but this isn't really it, another armed Knight... Yep, the blue portal told
you, didn't it? The next room is pitch dark. Simply head slightly right and you
should see stairs going up, take them and grab the Compass from the chest, then
go left from there to another structure but with an actual flight of stairs. 
Once up, head north and right, then drop through the middle hole to reach a 
chest with a key. Go back up but this time take the first exit south.

Destroy the enemies here before you decide to clone yourself. Now, use the 
panels on the far right, the far left and the very middle, then charge up your 
sword and head down pronto to hit the four switches and head left. Avoid the 
rolling spikes as you go north and open the chest for another Small Key. Head 
right and jump down the ledge to open the door there.

Be careful with the timing here, as the floating bombs can wreck you up as you 
make your trip rightwards and upwards. In the next room head north first and 
hit both switches with a spin attack, then head back down and up the stairs. 
Head left, drop down, kill the mages for the red Kinstone and head right to go
back up. This time go right, up and then left to another room with flame 
wizards. Dispose of them for the Dungeon Map and head left. Kill the Wall 
Masters and pull the lever. 

Head upstairs in the next room. Head left and up, killing the mummies, then 
drop a block and head up for a Heart Piece we saw earlier, but couldn't reach.
Head back down and drop down then head back up. Go right and watch the bomb 
floating; destroy it when it's besides the cracked blocks and jump away. Head
north and hit the switch, then circle around to grab the chest for 200 rupees.
Go back to the right and open the locked door but don't go up yet. Instead, 
head right and kill everything, then light the torches for the red portal. 
Now go up, bomb the wall and go out. Head up and exactly where that Stalfos was
besides the wall, bomb there to open the exit, bomb the cracked blocks and go 
through.

Here, DO NOT attack the bombs. You gotta make it around WITHOUT hitting the 
switch, that's right, don't touch the switch and go to the door on the other 
side. Grab the chest for another Small Key and go back down twice. Stand on the
cracked panels to fall down in front of the locked door. 

If you want a blue Kinstone, head right from where you begin and push the two 
panels besides the floor with pattern and below the chest. Otherwise, continue 
through the north, and fairly direct path. You have to try heading south and 
east to a floor with a design under two skulls to jump to the other side, of 
course, after pushing the blocks down. Before you head up the cloud stairs, 
jump to the right and use the cloud staircase if you want a red Kinstone. 
Otherwise, go up the other and into the boss room. Use the tornado and... 

This boss is fun if you ask me. You start in a blue thing that looks like a 
fish then you see a red bigged one. Jump on the red when it comes from behind
you. Ok, you see all those clone panels? Well, the fish thing will open up 
three out of the eight, you have to make clones in the same fashion and hit 
the eyes at the same time, then go and whack them like crazy. After each 
hitting session, the red one will retreat and you have to board the blue one 
while avoiding some attacks and as you hit the eye it pops open. As you 
progress, the fish thing will shoot some orbs that if they touch your clones 
(or you), the will disappear. Good luck. Just to tell, the blue small one will
fall first, then the red one bites the dust. 

Enjoy the Wind Element and your new Heart container, then head back to town.

BUT! Before you go to the castle, take into account that once you power up
the White Sword one last time, the town will go into an irreversible state, so
you might want to make a back up of your game. No, you won't miss anything if
you don't do it, just mentioning.
 
Now go the castle and power up your sword. Go up and watch the stained-glass 
with the cool music and then Vatii attacks... 
_______________________________________________________________________________
[036]---------------------03.06. Final Battle and More-------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Head out and use a spin attack to throw a small energy wave at each petrified 
person to unpetrify them. Once all three are back to normal head down. Now it 
isn't Hyrule's Castle, but Dark Hyrule's Castle... Head left and north a screen
and avoid fire in the next screen as you head up. Bomb the wall on the right 
here. Use the shrink stone in this room and head back to the room with the fire
and drop through the hole.

Head up from this room once and use the small passage to go into the first 
cell. Grow back and press the switch to open the prison locks. Use a charged 
attack on the King to unpetrify him. After you get the Small Key, head back up 
to the very beginning. You remember the first locked door we saw? Well, go down
from there to find the real locked door. Follow the only path and take the 
stairs to the right and go up to get the Dungeon Map. Then head back and go 
upstairs.

From here you can leave the castle, and I suggest you do. Here you can go out 
and try to get everything else. Head to the Heart Pieces, the Kinstone section 
and the Items section on how to get everything else. Be sure to get the Tiger
Scrolls too! Otherwise, here we go.

Head straight up once you are back in the castle and left on the next screen. 
Use the panels to make 3 clones and deflect the cannon balls with a sword slash
at the same time, so all four statues are destroyed in the same motion. Head up
and be careful with the vases and the Wall Masters.

In the next room you have to walk through all the tiles just once, or you will 
fail the puzzle.
From the beginning, in simple directions of D (Down), R (Right), L (Left) or U 
(Up), go:
R R R R U L L U R R U L L L U U R D R U R D R
And you are set. Head right and down for some more cloning fun.

Simply lead your clones and yourself down the path to hit the switches and grab
the Small Key. Go back to the main room, or the entrance if you wish and take 
the right stairs for the locked door and head downstairs.

Follow the path but do not jump down. Head up and using the panels try to make 
the following clone formation.
 _ _ _ _
|X| | |_|
|¯|¯ ¯|X| Where X stands for where a Link should be. 
|X|   |¯|
|¯|¯|¯|X|
 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
Charge up your sword and time yourself, then move between the four statues and 
try to bounce back their attacks with the spin attack. It might end up taking a
few tries, but once you are done, head up and kill everything, but bomb around 
the lower left wall. Head up and take the stairs.

Keep going for one of those Knights. Go right for the Compass then push the 
throne and head downstairs, follow the only path to head back up on the other 
side. And head up until you are out. Use the tornadoes to head down and enter 
the tower here. 

Clone yourself and be very careful with the fire as you head down to push the 
block. Then go out right and head down with more tornadoes. Ignore the entrance
and keep heading left. Using a Boomerang or arrow shoot at the switch to extend
the bridge and head inside that door. Clone yourself in accordance to the 
switches and hit them to proceed. Kill the two enemies there and head left and
up. Destroy the blocks there somehow and then jump into the wiring to hit the 
switches and proceed through the door.

Head right and up for another Knight. You see all those Knights that showed up 
when this one went down? Well, we gotta take care of them now in order to get 
the 4 Small Keys we need. Head down and right for the first set then take the 
big door there, lit all the candles and kill all the ghosts in the next room so
you can then reach the Small Key.

Head to where we fought the last set of Knights and head down from there, jump 
up into the wire and jump off the ledge on the other side and fight the lone 
Knight and go down the giant door. Don't even think of cloning, you can simply 
head down, stand in the very middle of the switches and spin to get them all. 
Get the key after that by going up after pressing the switch. Go back to the 
last Knight room and take a left twice.

Kill the double set and head down for more panel fun. Go, from the normal 
floor:
D D D D D D R U R U U L U R R D D D D R R R U L U L U R U R D D R
Get rid of the ghosts and go out, left to the inside of a tower and up the 
steps for the key. Go back to the Knight room and head up twice.

Once this Knight is down, head up. Kill the red Stalfos and careful of the 
Wall Masters then head up and shoot at the four eyes. Push the blocks on the 
next room out of the way and fall down then head back up the stairs twice to 
get the key. There's nothing outside, so just head back to where we fought the
very first Knight here and go up again. Open all the locks and make clones to
push the block away and get the Boss Key. You know where the room is, so head 
there.

Head up the bridge and kill the mini guardian then head up then make clones to 
kill the Kobolds and press the switches and take down the knights. Then head up
to find Vatii.

Prepare yourself. For this fight, you see the small eyes he sends out? First 
destroy them with your sword and then hack at the eye of Vatii's body. If the 
eyes are surrounded in a black aura, use the Jar to suck the aura away and 
destroy them. Repeat until done. Be careful though, the eyes can shoot out 
lasers and Gufuu can teleport around, as well as send out balls of fire.

The next form is slightly irritating... First, use the Bow to shoot the small 8
balls that surround him until you get 4 in red color (The pattern changes per 
session), then make the same pattern in clones and hit them at the same time 
and hack away. Repeat. This guy can jump around and send a lot of debris around
that will stay in the floor and can damage you if touched. Can be cleared with
sword swipes though as well as sending electricity balls at you. Repeat until
this guy goes down, again... Once you are back in the Dark Hyrule Castle, head
up to find Zelda, still petrified... Use a charged attack to send the energy
wave at her and restore her to normal. The castle will start to colapse and you
start heading out but the exit is already blocked!

Head down, to the garden, just before the shrine and Vatii will strike back!
This time, you have to wait until he plugs and arm down and it surfaces, then 
use the Cane to stop it and make it show a small entrance. Shrink with 
the stone and go inside. There, out of all the drones that fly around, try to 
hit the one with the eye in any other direction that's not in the center of the
eye. This will destroy the arm, if you destroyed that drone though. Repeat with
the other hand.

Then grow back and make your clones. Wait for the eyes to shine and shoot an 
energy ball and bounce it back to hit the eyes. If done correctly, you will 
stun Vatii and then hack at him. Repeat until that guy finally goes down. This
one ain't so hard...

"Thus did Link's quest come to an end."
"But surely, this is not the end of Zelda and Link's adventures in Hyrule."
"The legend will continue..." 
"...As long as the power of the light force echoes throughout the ages."

And it's over... Watch the closing and for now, you can save the game, as this 
will allow you to continue and collect whatever you missed, but for now, sit 
back, hold your GBA/SP up proudly and watch the ending...

---------------------------------05. Kinstones---------------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
_______________________________________________________________________________
[051]-----------------------------05.01. Types---------------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
There are several Kinstone designs. In general, blue, red and green are used 
for everyday normal fusing, whereas Golden ones are used only for story 
advancement. You can find green ones from defeating enemies and cutting grass,
but red and blue are only obtained from chests. 

Instead of trying to make a cheap description of each Kinstone, go here instead
and look at the picture:
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v433/GrayFox2510/TLZKS.jpg

Simply link the [Letter]/[Number] with the ones show in the Fuse List.
_______________________________________________________________________________
[052]---------------------------05.02. Fuse List-------------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I won't list the original fuse, the special ones (Golden) and the Tingle ones 

Before we start though, take in mind that some of the green Kinfusions can
produce random effects. Some are set, and some apparently aren't... Also,
about 80% of the list below was done after the you power up your sword to the
last level, which modifies some things in town. So if you start Kinfusing 
before that, you might end up doing one of these with other characters, as if
you don't Kinfuse at first, and that character leaves, you can still fuse with
another for the same results... Yeah, sounded odd but heck.

About the digging Gorons. Well, there are 6 fusions that involve them, one
of the farmer and 5 wall devices. The first one, whichever you do, will trigger
the whole event and subsequent ones will add Gorons to the cause.

About the names, the first one comes from the European version, and the one
between ()'s is my translation from the Jp version or what I used to have
written in here.

     a path in the screen left and down from town.

[008]--------------------------08. Figurine List-------------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
So what are figurines you ask? Well, go to the tree house in the lower-left
corner of town to find out. Basically, as you keep punching in those SeaShells
you get a figurine that goes into your collection. Each time you get a new
one, the percentage probability for obtaining another new one decreases. Such
percentage can be increased by using extra SeaShells. 

Ok, it seems you can only get the figurines whose character you have seen, but
some don't fall under this category (I believe only enemies do). So if you are
missing some figurines, then you haven't spotted that enemy yet.

By the way, the last 6 figurines can only be obtained after you finish that
data. I.e., beat Vatii and save the game afterwards.

[009]----------------------------09. Sidequests--------------------------------
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
House Building:
 -> If you speak to Goman after he appears in town, he will mention he has a
    house that he would like to rent to someone, but needs a girl... Go figure.
    Go to the Inn and speak to any of the 3 ex-godesses to place her in the
    house. 
    After a while, Gorman will move to the north-west part of town, near a 
    Minish Hut. At this point walk towards the post office. You should see one
    of the carpenters there, Kinfuse with him and later Gorman will have
    yet another house. You can place another ex-Goddess here.
    The third house however is still a mystery however. All we know is that
    should be where the cat pen is (You know, the place you go through as
    Minish for the Bracelets), but so far, the answer of how to is still
    shrouded...
     Effects of the Charms:
     -> Din's: Doubles Strenght for a while.
     -> Nayru's: Doubles Defense for a while.
     -> Farore's: Raises Strenght and Defense slightly for a while.

Minish Seed: (Mentioned to me by Yudy) (Information completed by Chris
              Moeller)
 -> Go to the Minish Town in the Woods and to the room where you found the
    Blabber Nut. The Minish on the right upper side will ask for some Milk,
    Crenel Hot Spring Water and some Red Potion in that order and one at a 
    time. Take some time between each one and per each you turn in, the guy
    in the lower right section of the Market in Town will sell three more
    Picolytes. The first ones are Red, Green and White. The rest will appear
    as you progress this quest.
    -> Red: Increases odds of finding hearts. (100 Rupeers)
    -> Green: Increases odds of finding Mysterious Shells. (200 Rupees)
    -> White: Increases odds of finding Kinstones. (100 Rupees)
    -> Blue: Increases odds of finding items such as bombs/arrows. (200 Rupees)
    -> Yellow: Increases odds of finding Rupees. (200 Rupees)
    -> Orange: Increases odds of finding stray faeries. (300 Rupees)

Goron Digging and the Mirror Shield:
 -> Ok, first, refer to the Kinfusion List and search for "Wall Device"; there
    are 5 of them. Kinfuse with those things and do so with the top farmer in
    the farm below the Ranch as well to get all 6 Gorons. Once you are done
    with that and you get your bottle, Kinfuse with one of those Gorons to make
    the Bigoron show up. AFTER you finish the game, he will take your Shield.
    Go travel a while, finish Kinfusing, get Heart Pieces or what not and then
    come back to get your Mirror Shield.

This FAQ/Walkthrough is copyright of Alan Quirino (grayfox_2510 (at) hotmail 
(dot) com).

Ok, so let us go over a few basic things...

Ownership, Borrowing Info, Contributing, etc.:

1) Please do not take any of this without my consent or at the very least,
   without a written gratitude in wherever you posted this. I had to spend
   quite some time getting all there is to this, or at least as close as
   possible, and well, if you have written any document of this kind and
   someone took something without gratitude then you must know it sucks... 

2) Taking up part of the previos point, if you wish to take some information
   from my guide, then make it reasonable... I mean, don't take a whole 
   section. Nonetheless, give credit where it's due; golden rule of 
   GameFAQs.com. I don't mind if I'm not told, as long as I'm given credit
   for what I did to contribute.

3) So, you notice a similarity between my guide and a piece of someone's else
   but it looks out of place? What do you do? Simple, just let me know. 
   It might be a coincidence, it might be plagiarize, who knows, but I'll 
   contact the other author and find what's going on. Thank you for the 
   support if you do notice this by the way.

4) I try, but perhaps my efforts alone are not enough and thus I end up 
   missing something here or there. Contributions are of course welcome, but
   be sure to be looking at the latest version, which is always found here:
   http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/recognition/8373.html
   Or just to be sure, hit Ctrl+F5 while viewing this file to ensure it's not
   a cached version. Also, be sure to put "Yakusoku no Chi Riviera" or the 
   like as the subject of your mail. If you wish for me to put you under a
   special name, include so. I normally also include e-mails just for
   reference, but if you want otherwise, then please let me know.

Permission, Posting, etc.:

1) First and foremost, I am NOT allowing other sites to post my works. The only
   sites that are allowed to host this is GameFAQs.com, and on the rare 
   occasion GameSpot, but that's since they, and only they can directly link
   to the former site. So save us both our time and do not ask for permission
   to post this.

2) So, assuming you inded had permissiong to post this... Do not change the
   format, the font size, the font... Nothing. Why? Simple, the whole basis
   of this guide is based on the current format, so changing it will simply
   corrupt the whole file or make it hard to read. 

3) Pay note that this is a free FAQ/Walkthrough. I make nothing out of this,
   so why should you? In other words, don't charge people for this. If I
   allowed this to be on display in your site, it must be free. Do not go
   around distributing this asking for money either. In short, don't get
   money at all for this...

4) Yes, I do get questions about this... You are free to download this and
   store it on your computer. No problem with that, just be careful with the
   format unless you want to have trouble reading. But if you want to e-mail
   me for any reason, make sure you are using the latest version...

Mailing, Inquires, etc.:

1) Ok, first of all, go to the TOC (Table of Contents). Then look at it
   again, and again a third time. Sorry for stressing that out, but most often
   the answers to your questions can be found in a particular section of the
   guide. Make sure you are also viewing the latest version, which will always
   be found at:
   http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/recognition/8373.html
   Hit Ctrl+F5 to make sure you aren't seeing a cached version. That aside,
   if you still need to contact me for an inquire, then put a subject relevant
   to the game such as, but not limited to "Yakusoku no Chi Riviera."
   {No Subject) mails will be deleted 90% of the time, so...

2) In addition to the previous point, I reserve the right to answer or not, and
   as such, I will only answer questions that I missed to detail here at all,
   or extreme cases. Mails asking about information that is already found here 
   might, and probably will end up in the trash can on my mail account. 

3) A few things though, use proper grammar and spelling for all that is holy.
   Even if the answer can be found here, the odds of me answering a mail like
   those will raise if you took the time to write properly. Now, I understand
   not everyone knows English, heck, even mine ain't that good, but if so,
   say so. Is that so much to ask?

4) Lastly, I check my mail around twice a day. Some times even more, but on 
   the rare occasion, allow up to two business days for a reply. If they are
   gone and you haven't heard back from me, then either the mail got lost, both
   mine or yours. That, or I ignored your mail for X reason, such as, but not
   limited to: Crappy grammar, inquires already answered here, etc.

So what if it's a long TOS, it needs to be done nowadays... *Rolls eyes*
