<h1>Trojans</h1>
<p>As I have been very busy with my other projects, and have yet to feel compelled to write information about trojans, this project page has been left as unfinished.</p>
<p>This page will one day try to explain trojans, who creates trojans, why trojans are created, and simply understanding trojans. To fully understand trojans we must explore their creation and their features to fully understand why they exist.</p>
<p>For now see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)">Trojan horse</a> - A wikipedia entry. </p>
<p>If you are experiencing problems with trojans and other types of malware take a read of my <a href="http://www.hm2k.org/articles/malware.htm">malware</a> article. </p>
