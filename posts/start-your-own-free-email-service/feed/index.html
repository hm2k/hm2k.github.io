					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Hivemail: their support is ridiculously time consuming and lacking!&quot;

Jack, you&#039;ve received far more attention than any other customer who paid money for the software! I count 15 support answers on Oct. 3 only. And another ~140 support requests within the next 7 days, which have all been answered quite timely...

Sidenote: Jack never bought the script but was using the free version!

&quot;HEY! I just posted a comment on HIVEMAIL and want to discard it. I’ve worked it out.&quot;

It wasn&#039;t you who worked it out but us. We even contacted your webhost to sort out the DNS issue on your server.

And all this for free.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do NOT waste your time with Hivemail. Their support is ridiculously time consuming and lacking! They seemed like they were working hard to tag me along and not give me too much. I&#039;m not a computer programmer and their so-called manual is very vague. 

The support person by the name of Yannin promised to chat with me in order to get the mail service set up, but failed to do so. 

I wasted DAYS on this and got almost no where with it. I&#039;ve now discarded this project. 

The positive side to all of this is, at least I found out the real deal on this company before I invested all the monies it would have taken to get this all up and running. 

Oh and when I first chatted with this guy... I asked him a basic question about his service and I quote what he said to me, &quot;Ain&#039;t no cheap Indians here!&quot;

I can say for sure, that the Indians provide better support than what he gave, any day!]]></description>
