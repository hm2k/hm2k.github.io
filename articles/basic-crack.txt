Tools needed: (Try: http://kickme.to/protools)
W32Dasm 8.93 or above
HIEW 6.55 or above
Patch making program

OK, Firstly load an unchanged version of the program you are trying to crack
if it requires a serial then try and register it, if not, you may have difficulty
with this crack...
Write down the error message somewhere!
Open W32Dasm and disassemble the program, click go to Refs and click on string data refs,
search for your error message you took note of before then double click on it.
You should be taken to your error message with a set of instructions 
below, search down till you find the call bar and take note of the offset code
then search for the ref unconditional jump that should be above the error msg, 
if its not then search for the nearest one above. 
Go to the code offset location at the top the program and 
type in the ref unconditional code and then press enter. 
You will be taken to a new window which has the Jne bar on it, 
take the offset code and close W32dasm. Start up Heiw and open up your unchanged
version of the program and go to decode mode [F4] then select decode mode press [F5]
then type in  your code ofset for the wrong serial then press [F3] to edit it, 
just type 90 five times  it dosen't matter if it jumps some lines.
Then press [F9] to update the program> Press [F5] and search for the 
for the ref code you and press enter.
You will be taken to the Jne bar the 4 numbers you will see 75 just press [F3]
and type 74, then [F9] to update.

BINGO! Run your program now, and with luck it should be cracked ;)

Then get hold off a patch making program and put in the relivant information, all done!
