										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently had an issue with a US based company who asked us for the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Copy of your business license via PDF/JPG scanned (preferred) and emailed or faxed</p></blockquote>
<p>We went on to explain that we don&#8217;t have a business license, they clearly didn&#8217;t understand and they proclaimed:<span id="more-655"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Most cities and many counties do require businesses &#8212; even tiny home-based sole proprietorship &#8212; to register with them and pay at least a minimum tax. In return, your business will receive a business license or tax registration certificate. Even if they do not require you to have one in the UK, we do. We must have something on files stating something along the lines that you are allowed to conduct business in your country.</p></blockquote>
<p>I explained that in the UK there is no such thing as a business license, that is why there is no requirement.</p>
<p>I also stated that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are registered with HMRC to pay our tax, but they do not  provide a license, certificate or otherwise. Just a tax return form,  which you fill out and return every year.</li>
<li>We do not have a &#8220;Certificate of Incorporation&#8221; as a business is not a corporation.</li>
<li>We do not have a &#8220;local business office&#8221;, we have a Chambers of  Commerce, who, if contacted, will say same thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>To which they replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>To clarify, you are telling me there is absolutely nothing you can show us to prove that you are a registered business or allowed to conduct business in the UK?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>There must be something from your government you can provide that will show us you are a business.</p></blockquote>
<p>I went on to explain that our government provides no method to register with them  as a business and that in the UK you become a business as soon as you  begin trading as a business. Of course, we are registered with the  government for tax, but they only provide the tax return form.</p>
<p>To which they replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank you for your reply. After reviewing your detailed information and further investigation we found the information you provided is correct, and you do not need a business license.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, that&#8217;s right folks: You don&#8217;t need a business license to run a business in the UK.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday July 19 2009 Hardy announced on the <a href="http://www.efnet.org/">EFnet website</a> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Internet">Demon Internet</a> will be <a href="http://forum.efnet.org/viewtopic.php?t=2491">delinking efnet.demon.co.uk and hub.uk</a> from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFnet">EFnet IRC network</a> in August.</p>
<p>For me, it marks the end of an era. There are no more UK IRC servers on the EFnet IRC network.</p>
<p><span id="more-515"></span></p>
<p>Gone are those days that I remember back in 1998 when the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459">IRC protocol</a> was an important part of the internet for any ISP.</p>
<p>It seems that IRC for many people has been replaced by many other services such as Instant Messaging, Social Networks, Blogs and BitTorrent. Yet IRC is still here.</p>
<p>I have put the delink down to the fact that Demon can no longer justify the running costs of such a service in the current economic climate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a real sign of the times when Demon, one of the first commercial UK ISPs can no longer support a service it has been running for over 16 years.</p>
<p>Demon has become a household name through the sponsorship of the EFnet IRC server and has become a very reputable ISP because of it, especially to administrators.</p>
<p>Demon has not released any kind of announcement nor has it updated it&#8217;s site to reflect the change and as I am not a Demon customer they have refused to comment on the situation.</p>
<p>Is this the end for EFnet UK? or Is this the start of the <a href="http://irchelp.org/irchelp/networks/efnetsux.html">end for EFnet</a>?Â  I hope not&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to start making steps in the right direction and so I&#8217;ve setup a website and mailing list called <a href="http://www.efnet.org.uk/">EFnet UK</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to be part of EFnet UK, please join the <a href="http://efnet.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/efnetuk_efnet.org.uk">EFnet UK mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>EFnet needs a new sponsor for a UK IRC server and we need your help to get one. Maybe you can help.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Update 09/10/09:</strong> Multiplay is now sponsoring a new EFnet UK server. <a href="http://stats.efnet.org/servers/view/?sid=8&amp;show=motd">efnet.demon.co.uk</a> is dead, long live <a href="http://stats.efnet.org/servers/view/?sid=127&amp;show=motd">efnet.multiplay.co.uk</a>. Thanks goes to <a href="http://twitter.com/jamesoff">@JamesOff</a>.</p>
