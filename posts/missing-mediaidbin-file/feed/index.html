					<description><![CDATA[sdutil seemed to work for me when I followed the instructions.  I found that after running it I had to have the backup on an external drive (not the internal D: that I really did the backup to) and the restore happened from there.  The restore operation skipped numerous files in both &quot;/program files...&quot; and the active user&#039;s registry file and numerous other files, as if restore doesn&#039;t run with admin privileges.

So the easy fix going forward is to always copy out the mediaid.bin file with the backup.  I just have to keep them paired with the correct backup file set, I assume.

Thanks much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic! Worked perfectly. Also, thanks for the link to download sdutil.zip.
I wasn&#039;t clear on where to get that file from. Microsoft website? But because you provided the link, it took care of that part of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, thanks for this post. In fact I get the Mediaid file with your indications, but once the Restore utility is started it still says it does not find a valid backup/restore file set. And everyting is there: the catalog, the zip files, etc.

Any clue of what might be happening?

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This walk-through for recreating the mediaid.bin file is spot on! :) However, for those of us that sometimes tend to take things a bit to literally, I&#039;d just like to clarify step #7 a bit to alleviate any potential confusion:

After accessing the correct drive letter for your backup, &quot;e:\&quot; in my case, the EXACT command I typed to recreate the mediaid.bin file was as follows,

       sdutil mediaid GlobalCatalog.wbcat e:\

The only difference that should exist in the above command is the letter of the drive where your backup resides.

Again, this walk-through is very helpful, I just didn&#039;t want anyone else to waste time making the same mistake I did (trying to run the command as &quot;sdutil mediaid GlobalCatalog.wbcat [backup drive e:\]&quot;). :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, thank you!  I had the same problem, search Google and Microsoft and couldn&#039;t come up with anything that would work, and was not about to call MS tech support.  Bill&#039;s comment (above) was the key - follow the steps EXACTLY.  On Windows 7, right click on command prompt and run as an Administrator.  Also, Windows file explorer  may not let you search the backup directory, but if you use something like xplorer2, its a breeze.  Once I figured out the above, the fix took two minutes and saved 500GB worth of backup.  You are a lifesaver.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Once I followed your instructions &quot;exactly&quot;, it worked perfectly.  BTW the backup was originally created on an XP machine, than at some time copied to a vista machine and by the time I needed to restore a file I was on WIndows 7.  If you follow the instructions it works perfectly.  Thanks a bunch!]]></description>
