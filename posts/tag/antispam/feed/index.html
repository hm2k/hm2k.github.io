										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many years back I began investigating anti email spam in the UK as a way to defend against the amount amount of email spam we were receiving to certain email addresses.</p>
<p>The reason this email address was getting so much spam is because it was harvested by a website spider bot, as the email address was placed on company website by the previous webmaster.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">DO NOT put your email address or any email addresses directly on your website, instead use a form.</p>
<p>Back then there was only examples of support for US, but very little support in the UK.</p>
<p>One thing I did find was the <a href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/Consumer/Spam/default.htm">Office Of Fair Trading Spam Tips</a> but they were not very useful, the JunkBusters.com website has some nice tips on &#8220;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091027232014/http://www.junkbusters.com/junkemail.html">junk email</a>&#8220;, if only something existed like this for the UK.</p>
<p>I discovered that in the US you can send your junk/spam email to <a href="mailto:spam@ftc.gov">spam@ftc.gov</a> and they will pursue law enforcement actions against people sending the emails.</p>
<p>After I read the <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/privacy_and_electronic/introductory/rules_~1.pdf">NEW RULES ON EMAIL MARKETING</a> article, I figured I could issue a complaint with the <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints/privacy_and_electronic_communications.aspx">Information Commissioner</a> via <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints/~/media/documents/library/Privacy_and_electronic/Forms/pecr_complaints_form.doc">this form</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In 2010 the BBC offered an article entitled: &#8220;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/guides/stopping-spam-emails">How can I stop getting spam emails?</a>&#8221; which seems to offer sufficient advice, there&#8217;s also a whole heap of resources in the Dmoz &#8220;<a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/E-mail/Spam/">email spam</a>&#8221; directory.</p>
