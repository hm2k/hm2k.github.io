					<description><![CDATA[Good day,
I just come across of your &quot;dialog&quot; with &quot;macadam&quot; from a while ago. (below) about protecting osTicket form
a spam.
&quot;Yes it comes from the form as the department is correctly selected...
I have modified the system and added a capcha image.

Is any one interested by the patch?

macadam&quot;    

Have you managed to get this patch? I&#039;m not familiar with PHP programming, and it would be extremely helpful to get this patch.
Thank you,
Derek]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi - 

I have just installed eticket and am hoping to use it for all my supprt on my new project. I had some initial problems but &quot;think&quot; I have it up and running.. I tried to register on the forum where you posted your themes but it seems new registration is disabled.

If it isn&#039;t too much trouble I would love to have the the theme you posted: http://eticket.sourceforge.net/themes/eticket-admin.gif

This just happens to totally match my website colors, etc. and would be perfect for my support solution.

Thanks so much for your time.

Best Regards,
Steve]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good Job on e-ticket. Its everthing i like abouit os-ticket and it actually works :) 

I have one problem though. It seems that for some reason at random times the css is not applied to the index page. All i see is an unformated html page. when view source, it seems the header is missing. 

If i view that page some time later, everything is fine. I&#039;ve tested on different computers on different networks and the problem pops up in both firefox and ie7. I have not experienced it on ie6 as yet. 

any idea whats causing this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I came across your development of eTicket support system.
I&#039;d like to combine it with my shopping site that is currently running ZenCart so that customers
can issue support tickets for things like returns, sales questions etc.

Do you undertake projects such as this and would it be possible to combine into Zencart?

Regards,

Daniel]]></description>
