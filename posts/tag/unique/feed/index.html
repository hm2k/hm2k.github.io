										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When trying to create a unique company name for your business, I found that there was a three step approach to creating a unique name.</p>
<p>When I was developing a new company name, I created about 20 using this method, each time I would follow the steps through to create a name that was appropriate, unique and usable.</p>
<p><span id="more-164"></span><strong>1. Get inspiration </strong></p>
<p>First of all you have to select a few sources for inspiration. You need ideas as to what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>Most companies begin by thinking up variations of the activity they do (ie: for a company selling mobile phone: mobile, phone, cell, sales, etc), however sometimes a company may not sell anything specific, and may cover many different activities.</p>
<p>You can try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_company_name_etymologies">investigating other company names</a>, to see where they got their inspiration from.</p>
<p>Find words that you like, or that sound as if they relate to your general activities.</p>
<p>Look at your own name, and names of others involved in the company, see if they can give inspiration.</p>
<p>Place names are good too, see if you can become establish based on the name of your area.</p>
<p><strong>2. Generate a unique name </strong></p>
<p>Once you have your inspiration, there&#8217;s a few techniques you can use to get the unique name that you are looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=crossword+helper">Crossword Helper</a>/Solver &#8211; This will allow you to use certain formulas to pick words. (ie: using the initials of the partners to help you generate appropriate words).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=thesaurus">Thesaurus</a> &#8211; Allows you to find synonyms for words your choice of words.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=anagrams">Anagrams</a> &#8211; Use this with a combination of names involved in the company or such.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=translator">Translator</a> &#8211; Try translating a few words you&#8217;ve chosen to get that unique angle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Validate it&#8217;s usable<br />
</strong></p>
<p>You should really ensure that the name you choose is not in use, recommendations for ensuring they are not in use include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check with your common sense &#8211; If your company is only open 12 hours a day, for gods sake, don&#8217;t call your company &#8220;24seven&#8221;.</li>
<li>Checking with government departments (in the UK such as <a href="http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/">CompaniesHouse WebCheck</a>).</li>
<li>Check the registered trademarks database for your country and possibly major countries such as <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">US</a> and <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-text/">UK</a>, as existing companies may wish to expand into your country, meaning you would not be authorised to use the name.</li>
<li>Check with <a href="http://www.yell.com/">yellow pages</a>, and ensure there&#8217;s no one already using the name.</li>
<li>Check with <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, check for variants (eg: &#8220;my idea&#8221;, myidea, etc), if it&#8217;s commonly used by a website or company for their product or service, then chances are they could battle you over rights to the name. Avoid where possible.</li>
<li>Check that there is no <a href="http://whoisx.co.uk/">active domain name</a> using your name, (eg: myidea.com). Sometimes domain names are not in use and are just parked/advertising/on sale, always check first.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Once you have a sufficient amount of names, gather feedback from your friends and family.</p>
<p>I found asking them their top 5 and their bottom 5 helped narrow down the choices.</p>
<p>This will help you settle on a name that will work for you and your customers.</p>
<p><strong>If all else fails&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>You could always try the assistance of a <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding/Naming/">naming firm</a> or a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=company+name+generator">company name generator</a>, but there&#8217;s nothing quite like your own inspiration, so don&#8217;t give up straight away.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I DO NOT help you choose a company name for free.</em></p>
