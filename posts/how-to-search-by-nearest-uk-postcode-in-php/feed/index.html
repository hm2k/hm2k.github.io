					<description><![CDATA[hmm scrap that last message - I simply didnt round it. rounding to 2 decimal places made it 0. However the fact that it requires rounding is odd - it should be 0 without rounding, shouldnt it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey,

I have just tried out the distance function at the top. I copied and pasted the code then modified it with the variable names I originally used. However it seems that the distance between DT11 and DT11 is just over 5 miles. Any idea why?

Please email me if you have an idea.

Regards,

Richard]]></description>
