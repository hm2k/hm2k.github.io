This will render hm2k.org redundant and over-time will redirect to hm2k.com once all is well.<br /><br />And yes, I have been suckered into being "web 2.0" and become a blogger, I intend on making a new post everyday... at least for the first month.<br /><br />Enjoy!|||8||
1156171227|HM2K|A good Editor|I am looking for a good open source or free cross platform (windows/linux) editor that has php and html syntax highlighting.<br /><br />A simple request I thought, I guess not...<br /><br />Originally I was looking for an editor that did the above and had the ability to edit remote files, however after taking another look at FileZilla as documented in my [link=http://www.hm2k.org/news/1133012808.html]Finally, a decent FTP client[/link] article, I realised I can set it up to edit remote files, which download into a temp directory, which upon editing and closing FileZilla realises there has been a change and re-uploads the file. This is all very well, however it makes testing a little more delayed. Therefore an editor with a built in FTP option would be great.<br /><br />So far the only editor that is even close to what i'm after is EditPlus2, however it is neither free or open source, nor does it run on Linux platforms.<br /><br />The hunt continues...|||||

1144081519|HM2K|Moola.com - Make a mint by playing online flash games!|Earn money by playing games!<br /><br />Yes thats right, you heard it here first! This is the next big thing...<br /><br />There's no signup fee or anything like that, only problem is, its currently invite only as its beta.<br /><br />I've got to level 6 so far, which was cool, i'm getting quite good at it now, but there's 30 levels in total, and there's only one game at the moment entitled "Gold Rush".<br /><br />How it works...<br />Once you have signed up you can start to play. You can play people at either the same level as you or levels below, the higher the level the more risk there is, the lower the levels the less there is to win.<br /><br />So you enter a game, you then watch an advertisement and answer a question on the advert (these get tiresum and samey after a while), this is how they make their money on this, via sponsorship deals, from people such as Nokia.<br /><br />The website then attempts to find a player for you, once they are found you can accept or deny them (this is useful if you have played them before), there is an intro, but once you're in the game you can see the user your playing against, their avatar, and when they joined.<br /><br />The game starts, you have 5 peices of gold their value is between 1 and 6, then there is what is best described as a sea-saw in where a peice of gold is placed by the computer, which is randomly worth between 1 and 6 again. The aim of the game is to out weigh the opponent.<br /><br />Most of the time this is down to chance, but after an hours worth of play, you start to get the hang of it and can predict what your opponent is likely to do. After you have used up your 6 peices of gold the game is over, whoever has the most gold is the winner.<br /><br />It is a little difficult to explain yes, however once you give it a go you'll figure it out.<br /><br /><img style="border: none;" alt="Moola" src="http://www.hm2k.org/news/data/upimages/moola_small.jpg" /> <br /><br />Visit [link=http://www.moola.com/]moola.com[/link]<br /><br />Note: Payout is only to US/CA at the moment.

1140868581|HM2K|Alexa Tips and Tricks|Top Ten Alexa Tips and other information you should know about Alexa<br /><br />1. How to show up in another website's related links.<br /><br />By suggesting other links for your website, that causes them also to be considered<br />related links to other websites. To suggest related links for your own website, go<br />to...<br /><br />http://www.alexa.com/data/details/editor?type=rl&url=<br /><br />... and append your domain name on the end of the link.<br /><br />2. How to update the thumbnail image Alexa has for your site.<br /><br />To update the thumbnail that Alexa has for your site, just add<br />your domain to the end of this URL:<br /><br />http://thumbnails.alexa.com/update_thumbnail?url= <br /><br />3. How to see website traffic across non-standard date-ranges.<br /><br />Alexa typically allows you to view 4 different default date spans:<br /><br />   1. 3 Months<br />   2. 6 Months<br />   3. 1 Year<br />   4. 2 Years<br /><br />... but by manipulating the URL directly, you can modify that to whatever<br />you want, down to 2 days or all the way up to 4 years.<br /><br />To do this, simply go to the graph you want to see using one of Alexa's<br />default time spans, and then modify the part of the URL that looks like this...<br /><br />traffic_details?&range=3m<br /><br />In this range parameter, "d" = day, "m" = month and "y" = year.<br /><br />Replacing "&range=3m" with "&range=8d" will cause the graph to span for 8 days.<br /><br />4. How to get included in Alexa's hierarchical directory.<br /><br />Alexa's directory is powered by the Open Directory Project.<br /><br />To be included in the directory, go to http://www.dmoz.org/<br />and submit your site. A human editor will review your site and place<br />it in the proper category.<br /><br />Once that's done, it will automatically be picked up by Alexa.<br /><br />5. How to remove the Alexa toolbar from your browser.<br /><br />Alexa offers two help pages to assist you in removing the toolbar:<br /><br />    * http://pages.alexa.com/exec/faqsidos/help/index.html?index=7<br />    * http://pages.alexa.com/exec/faqsidos/help/index.html?index=38<br /><br />... but many people find it necessary to resort to a spyware removal tool<br />that has Alexa-removal capabilities. eg: http://hop.clickbank.net/?auctions20/noadware<br /><br />6. How to make your own Alexa toolbar.<br /><br />To make your own toolbar, go here...<br />http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/associatetoolbar.html<br /><br />7.  How to get Alexa data in XML format free.<br /><br />Go here...<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/sdk/103-0004624-0694231?s=AlexaWebInfoService&v=1-0<br /><br />8. How to get Alexa data as an RSS feed.<br /><br />You can get several things from Alexa as an RSS feed, such as:<br />    * Movers and Shakers<br />    * Top 500 Sites<br />    * Top 100 English Sites<br />    * ... and more.<br />To sign up for an RSS feed, go here...<br />http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/rss_feeds.html<br /><br />9.

1139531105|HM2K|Unlock code for Motorola|I was given a Motorola V525 as the original owner had an upgrade. They are on the vodafone network, and I am on O2.<br /><br />When I put an O2 simcard in the phone it asked me to "Enter Subsidy Password" (other phones may say "Enter Special Code"), I tried a few random numbers (probably about 15 by the time I had finished), and the phone locked up. Displaying the following: "Contact Service Provider", and it will not go away.<br /><br />However, there is a solution I found at: [link]http://www.gsm-unlock.com/unlock/unlock-motorola.html[/link]<br /><br />[quote]Q: I keep getting the following prompt on my Motorola after I insert another sim card "Contact Service Provider" ?<br />A: That means wrong unlock code has been entered already!<br />(This message appears after many wrong subsidy or special code entry)<br />Power on phone and wait between 30 min to 8 hours till Enter Subsidy or Special Code<br />message appear again! (Please note that phone should be powered on during this time).[/quote]<br /><br />I left it turned on, and charging over night, and came to it the following day, it asked me for the unlock code.<br /><br />After reading the forum here: [link]http://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/1/283892[/link] I discovered that you CANNOT unlock the Razr V3, or V525 or any other Motorola simply by providing someone with your IMEI code.<br /><br />As far as I can see there are only THREE ways around this:<br />1. You need a datacable (~$10) and MotoPhoenix ($25) from [link]http://www.motophoenix.com/moto_unlock.htm[/link] -- It seems this guy here has achieved it using a datacable and some choice software... [link]http://www.mark-world.tv/motorola/manual.pdf[/link]<br />2. Contact your phone carrier/operator or service provide (O2, Orange, Vodafone, T-Mobile, etc) and ask them for the unlock code, like this guy did: [link]http://www.radwin.org/michael/blog/2004/04/tmobile_sim_unlock_part_1.html[/link]<br /><br />They will ask you for the following details:<br /><br />[quote]Mobile Telephone Number:<br />Customer Account Number:<br />Full Name:<br />Full Address:<br />Date of Birth:<br /><br />Make:<br />Model:<br />IMEI: [/quote]<br /><br />3. The third way involves using buy methods, such as buying from ebay, gsm-unlock.com or fonefunshop.co.uk, but as these methods are completly untested (by me), and they don't tell you how it works, I wouldn't advise them.<br /><br />I used method 2, and after a few emails back and forth, and a phone call from the previous owner, I was provided with 2 unlock codes and told that one of them would work.<br /><br />I hope this helps!|||15||

I'm going to look on...<br /><br />[link=http://www.pureftpd.org/]PureFTPD[/link] - Although there is a win32 release, its difficult to work with, no easy way to configure your server, it does not run in the background without 3rd party software, even though it does have a tray icon, but all in all its fairly useless -- I couldn't even locate the config file. This thing is designed on and for Unix, not Windows, as I found.<br /><br />[link=http://www.warftp.org/]warFTPD[/link] - After much clicking around their website, I managed to actually download this software, only to be faced with a load more screens of clicking in the installation.

I decided to give this one a miss before the installation was over.<br /><br />[link=http://www.gene6.com/]Gene6[/link] - Its good, the trial only lasts 30 days though and it costs over £30, I just don't think its worth the price. Changing the port was difficult at first, but I figured you needed to add a domain first, and it worked, its a bit of an odd setup, but it worked.<br /><br />[link=http://www.raidenftpd.com/]RaidenFTPd[/link] - Costs over $19.95, however it was really really easy to setup. The problem was that the shareware splash screen was so annoying I could not seem to rid of it, it would not let me continue only quit, so I uninstalled it.<br /><br />[link=http://www.guildftpd.com/]guildFTPd[/link] - This one was yet another dirty peice of software, hard to use and navigate, so much so you need to read their guide on it.

However it does turn out to uninstall very quickly and easily.<br /><br />[link=http://www.bpftpserver.com/]BPFTPd[/link] - Apparently its based on the old Gene6, it has a 15 day trial.

1134946121|HM2K|Paypal Officially SUCKS!|My company (and myself) have been using Paypal for means of payment for well over 2 years now, yet it seems that Paypal sucks more than ever.<br /><br />Recently my company had an order from someone, the payment came through, but the order looked dodgy (you can always tell the dodgy ones, yahoo.com/hotmail.com email addresses, country on the postal address does not match the location of the IP address, or the IP address is on AOL, the name on the account does not match the name of the paypal account, etc), so the payment came through, it was a yearly fee, we didn't set it up as it was obviously fraud, and no doubt someone in a couple of days time will realise and simply issue a charge back.<br /><br />However in this case, the guy complained to us and said he had made no order of this kind, as expected, but when he complained to paypal, he said he had not received the service he had paid for, rather than simply issuing a charge back.<br /><br />In turn, paypal have decided to disable our account, and we have spent the last 17 days trying to resolve the issue(s), and get our account reactivated.<br /><br />It has been a NIGHTMARE, and we cannot receive payments (about 90% of our payments ARE paypal) until the issue is resolved.<br /><br />This brings me onto my next note...<br /><br />[link=http://paypalsucks.org/]<img style="border: none;" alt="" src="http://www.hm2k.org/news/data/upimages/PPS-Cartoon1.gif" />[/link]<br /><br />Cartoon by [link=http://paypalsucks.org/]PayPalSucks.org[/link]<br /><br />Try and avoid using paypal where possible, try alternatives such as [link=http://www.nochex.com/]nochex[/link]|||4||

1134746979|HM2K|Google Music Search|I forgot to post this new feature on Google that I was informed about.<br /><br />So here it is...<br /><br /> [quote]It may come as no surprise, but I like to search for things on Google. Yep, when I'm looking for something, I always try it on Google first. And sometimes, that thing I'm looking for is music. Many of our users feel the same way, and we get a lot of search traffic on music terms like popular artists and albums.<br /><br />A few of us decided to try to make the information you get for these searches even better, so we created a music search feature. Now you can search for a popular artist name, like [link=http://www.google.com/search?q=the+beatles]the Beatles[/link] or the [link=http://www.google.com/search?q=pixies]Pixies[/link], and often Google will show some information about that artist, like cover art, reviews, and links to stores where you can download the track or buy a CD via a link at the top of your web search results page.<br /><br />We do this sort of thing a lot -- adding a bit of special information to results for important searches. For example, we have [link=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=king+kong++movie&btnG=Search]movie showtimes[/link] and [link=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=goog&btnG=Search]stock quotes[/link]. The more information we can make easily accessible with a simple search, the better.<br /><br />Right now the music search feature mostly works for artists popular in the U.S. and a more limited number of artists from other countries, but we plan to expand it to classical music, worldwide artists, and lesser-known performers. Our list of music stores will also grow over time. If you’re a music store (selling downloads, music by subscription, or physical CDs) and would like to be listed, [link=http://www.google.com/support/bin/request.py]please get in touch[/link].<br /><br />You might be thinking,"why can't I just type in an album name or a song name and get the same music search results?” There are many album names and songs which are also plain English words. Sometimes users are looking for music information related to those words, and sometimes they aren’t. As we get better at knowing when our users want music information, we hope to expand this feature to include more queries. So keep searching, and we hope you'll be pleasantly surprised with the results. We always welcome your [link=http://www.google.com/support/bin/request.py]feedback[/link].[/quote]<br /><br />[link=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/searching-for-music.html]Source[/link]|||12||

1131635501|HM2K|Bored?|Are you bored? Have nothing better to do? Below is a list of things to do when you are bored... Enjoy!<br /><br />[quote]THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING<br /><br />Push your eyes for interesting light show<br />(Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes)<br />See a variety of blobs, stars and flashes. Try to make out things your subconscious is trying to send you a message? Can you control what you see by pressing different areas with different forces? Would it be possible to somehow see the same effects on TV?<br /><br />See how long you can hold your breath<br />(Amusement Potential: 4-20 minutes)<br />Not that much fun, but it sure passes the time. Play with a friend, or try to beat your own personal best. Some tips: hyperventilate before hand, and stay as still as possible. My personal best is 2:00 (exactly).<br /><br />Try to not think about penguins<br />(Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes)<br />This is especially hard, because by trying too much, you remember what you were trying to avoid thinking of. If you try too little, you end up thinking about penguins anyway.<br /><br />Use your secret mind power<br />(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)<br />Pick a passing by and try to use your mind power to command them do something, like drop their bag or knock into someone. The law of averages dictates that sooner or later one of your mind commands will come true, so you can convince yourself that you really have super human powers and waste even more time trying them out.<br /><br />Scratch yourself<br />(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)<br />Go ahead, scratch yourself now. Even if nothing itches, go ahead. Doesn't that feel pretty good?<br /><br />Repeat the same word over and over until it loses its meaning<br />(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)<br />Pick a random word out of a magazine and say it aloud to yourself until it becomes a meaningless set of noises.<br /><br />Hurt yourself<br />(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)<br />What is pain? Why is it unpleasant? There's nothing physical about it - it's all in your mind. Plus, after pinching yourself for awhile, boredom will seem nice next to being in pain.<br /><br />Try to swallow your tongue<br />(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)<br />There's not much to say about this one. It is possible.<br /><br />Pretend to be a car<br />(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)<br />Make appropriate revving noises in your head as you walk along and add a racing commentary as you pass strangers in the street. Use blinking eyes as indicators for extra authenticity.<br /><br />Look at something for awhile, shut eyes, study after image<br />(Amusement Potential: 2-5 minutes)<br />Another great time waster. It takes about 30 seconds of staring to create an after image, and the image is then viewable for about the same length of time. Fun to combine this one with pushing on your eyes.<br /><br />Get yourself as nauseated as possible<br />(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)<br />Best achieved by looking straight up and spinning around. Try to be so dizzy you can't even stand up. This is also entertaining due to the "makes boredom seem a lot better" effect (see "Hurt Yourself").<br /><br />THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH VERY LITTLE<br /><br />See what's in your neighbour's rubbish/trash<br />(Amusement Potential: 20-30 minutes)<br />You can learn a lot about people by what they throw out. You might uncover some dark secret about them. Plus, they might be throwing out something with value that still works, like a VCR or some porn mags.<br /><br />Watch TV, repeat everything said in Italian accent<br />(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)<br />Sort of entertaining. Include flamboyant shoulder shrugs for added impact, or go for a Marlon Brando set of grunts.<br /><br />Send spooky emails<br />(Amusement Potential: 15-60 minutes)<br />Look up someone's CV on the web, do some research on them via Google and then send them an email full of personal references claiming to be an ex-work colleague who fell in love with their shoes. Or something.<br /><br />Play our useless games<br />(Amusement Potential: how long have you got?)<br />Waste away the hours with our collection of useless games<br /><br />Make prank phone calls<br />(Amusement Potential: 20-60 minutes)<br />Very entertaining, but requires discipline. Remember - vulgarities don't make a call funny, but getting the other person to believe a ridiculous story will. Try seeing if you can get them to make noises to 'test' the line. One to get you started off: Call McDonalds with weird complaints about their food.<br /><br />Pretend all humans will die except for people in room with you<br />Amusement Potential: 10-20 minutes)<br />What would you do if this really happened? Would the group stay together, or would there be factions? Who would join what group? Remember, there would only be power for a few days before the plants ran out of fuel or broke. To travel, you would always have to be near cars to siphon gas out of. Best to do with people you know.<br /><br />Step off a curb with eyes shut, imagine it's a cliff<br />(Amusement Potential: 2-5 minutes)<br />To get any benefit out of this one, you have to have a good imagination. Don't step off immediately, build up to the jump. Study the ravine below. Feel the winds at that altitude. Step off and...AHHHHHH!!!!!<br /><br />Try and sound Welsh<br />(Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)<br />The key to sounding Welsh is to make sure that your voice goes up at the end of the sentence, so that everything sounds like a question. Throw in a superfluous 'isn't it?' at the end of everything you say and you're halfway there. Isn't it?<br /><br />Burn things with a magnifying glass<br />(Amusement Potential: 5-30 minutes)<br />Ants are always fun to use for this, but burning the face of someone you don't like, under some circumstances, can be just as entertaining.<br /><br />THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH ANOTHER PERSON<br /><br />Have a water drinking contest<br />(Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)<br />While the competition is fun, you probably won't feel too good afterward. To give your event an old western theme, slam the cups upside down on the tables after you have emptied them.<br /><br />Stare at the back of someone's head until they turn around<br />(Amusement Potential: 2-5 minutes)<br />This works on the "I have the feeling I'm being watched" principle. Conduct an experiment-does this really work?<br /><br />Have a "Who is less competitive" competition<br />wonder (Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)<br />Trying to win at this will make you lose. Trying to lose makes you win which makes you lose. Not trying at all makes you lose which makes you win which makes you lose.<br /><br />Pick up a dog so it can see things from your point of view<br />(Amusement Potential: 3-5 minutes)<br />Think about it: your dog has only seen the house from a viewpoint from 6" to 2' high (15 to 60 cm for all you metric fans). It's never seen the tops of counters, what you keep on your desk, the tops of shelves, etc. Try looking at things from its point of view, too.<br /><br />Pull out a hair, stick in someone's ear<br />(Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes)<br />Best done to sleeping people. Added challenge in having no one else around, because then you can't blame it on anyone else. Try to beat your record number of times before the person catches on.<br /><br />Pour water in hand, make sneeze noise, throw water on back of person's neck<br />(Amusement Potential: 5-15 minutes)<br />Always a good gag. For an even bigger reaction out of the person, act like you're not sorry at all for what they think you did. Comment instead on how big that sneeze was or about how there was a lot of mucus in that one.[/quote]<br /><br />[link=http://www.urban75.org/useless/bored.html]Source[/link]|||2||

1130680051|HM2K|Updated|Incase you hadn't noticed, I have changed HM2K.org, i've cut it down to the bare essentials, to give people exactly what they want.<br /><br />I decided to do this since I have updated a few of my scripts and released some new ones, yet found it difficult to announce, and organise.<br /><br />I have also changed the site over from a table layout to a css layout, apparently its the "in thing" to do in the internet industry, so if it looks crap in your browser don't blame me, blame the industry.<br /><br />The flash and gallery have been removed. The flash has moved over to [link=http://www.rofl.name/]ROFL.name[/link] anyway. And the gallery will probably return in private form.<br /><br />I still have a few things to sort out with the news, but that can wait for now.<br /><br />All the articles and scripts have been made a bit more openly avalible.<br /><br />The most important thing for now is the files and the projects. Over the next few months I will be creating project pages for each of the projects listed, then using this I will be releasing the various information/files via these pages.<br /><br />A few updated files that you might want to note include:<br />[link=http://www.hm2k.org/scripts/wget.mrc]wget for mIRC[/link] - A very useful script, its meant to be a (simple) version of wget for unix based systems, you can simply type: /wget [url] and it will download the file to your mirc downloads folder.<br />[link=http://www.hm2k.org/scripts/lnks.mrc]lnks.us script[/link] - Since smlnk is no longer in use, I decided to change the script to work with [link=http://lnks.us/]lnks.us[/link] run by netmunky.<br />[link=http://www.hm2k.org/scripts/myip.mrc]MyIP lookup script[/link] - whatismyip.com changed their html code *doh*, script was updated.<br />[link=http://www.hm2k.org/files/hm2k_cjb.zip]CJB.net Updater script for mIRC[/link] - Due to the myip lookup change, this script was updated.<br />[link=http://www.hm2k.org/files/hm2k_notepod.zip]Notepod for mIRC[/link] - enter a new notepod, its still in beta, but its the best and quickest notepod for mirc out there.<br />and most importantly...<br />[link=http://www.hm2k.org/scripts/moo.mrc]moo script v3.0 *beta* (for mIRC v6.16 or above - no more moo.dll)[/link] - Thats right, no need for moo.dll anymore, but it is still in beta, as there are some bugs and it can be a bit slow at times.<br /><br />(See, I have been busy. Let me know if I have missed anything.)<br /><br />Links are no more, at least for now, however I will be writing a linkback monitoring script and prises will go to people sending me the most traffic.<br /><br />Thanks and enjoy.|||8||
